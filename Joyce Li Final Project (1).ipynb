All rights reserved. 1 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most At a Glance Utilities have underinvested in their transmission and distribution infrastructure for decades, but investment in the grid is on the rise. Strategic T&D investments improve reliability, which in turn reduces costs and improves the customer experience by reducing the frequency and duration of outages. Leading utilities use data and advanced analytics to make better decisions about where to invest in the grid. The grid’s appetite for investment seems nearly infinite. Utilities could spend unlimited amounts upgrading their aging transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure to increase reliability and resiliency and to ensure the flexibility to integrate more renewable generation resources. However, since unlimited funds are rarely available, and utilities are under cost and earnings pressure, they have to decide which investments are most important. Executives must try to ensure that improvements in the grid will accomplish three important goals: • increase reliability; • improve the customer experience; and by doing so • reduce operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. Those questions have never been more pertinent or urgent, since investment in the grid is suddenly fashionable. For decades, large power generation projects attracted the lion’s share of investment, which resulted in limited funds for investment in the T&D grid. This has left the grid looking like a patchwork quilt of equipment varying in condition, reliability and cost to maintain. Now, with demand for electricity leveling off in developed markets, investments in traditional thermal power generation are less attractive. Interest has shifted to renewable generation and the grid. However, while T&D investment appeals to investors and senior executives, regulators can often remain wary, especially in some jurisdictions. This spending increases the rate base, but not all of it improves the value proposition for customers by delivering greater reliability, lowering costs or meeting other customer needs and expectations. Customer expectations continue to rise, and grid performance plays a significant role in customer experience and satisfaction levels. All customers have tipping points, some higher than others, when they experience too many “momentaries”—those annoying blinks in power 2 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most Forward-looking companies take a more fine-tuned approach to understanding grid performance and customer preferences, which allows them to invest more precisely in the places with the most potential. supply that cause computers to crash and force one to reset all electronic clocks—or sustained outages. At these tipping points, their satisfaction falls off a cliff. Leading utilities address this risk by using data and advanced analytics to make better decisions about T&D investment. These forward-looking companies take a more fine-tuned approach to understanding grid performance and customer preferences, which allows them to invest more precisely in the places with the most potential. This leads to a more effective deployment of capital and a much more data-driven and compelling story for regulators about the investment rationale and spending levels. This brief looks at the correlations between reliability, customer experience and cost, and it describes how leading utilities tap the power of analytics to create value from those insights. We also highlight the most important capabilities that utilities need to execute these initiatives successfully and offer thoughts on how to get started. Reliability, customer experience and cost The rationale for investing more in the grid is real and tangible. Utilities have underinvested in their T&D infrastructure for decades, and these older and less maintained grids require more and costlier maintenance. Cost-to-serve performance correlates directly to the quality and reliability of circuits; less reliable circuits are more expensive to maintain (see Figure 1). Lower reliability is expensive in other ways, too. Customer expectations are rising, and grid performance is a major factor in customer experience and satisfaction. Some customers have a higher tolerance for outages than others, but Net Promoter Score® analysis shows a clear trend: the more outages, the higher the percentage of detractors (see Figure 2). 3 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most Figure 2: In a sample region in the eastern US, few customers minded one or two days with momentary outages, but many more noticed when the number of days rose to three or more Note: Momentary outages are less than 2 minutes Sources: 2016–17 AMI data extract and customer Net Promoter Score® survey for a large, integrated utility in the US (n=~8,000); Net Promoter ®, Net Promoter System®, Net Promoter Score® and NPS® are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Fred Reichheld and Satmetrix Systems, Inc. 0 5 10 15% Number of days with momentary outages in the last 3 months Percentage of detractors 0 1 1 4 2 3 3 10 >3 13 Figure 1: Less reliable circuits cost more to maintain Source: Distribution reliability reports for six sample circuit clusters for a large, integrated utility in the US, 2017 Outages per customer (annual) Distribution O&M cost per customer (annual) Urban Rural 4 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most Leading utilities link that data to real experience, often by analyzing billions of power delivery records collected at the meters using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), as well as substation and line performance data. To maintain a good customer experience, some utilities overinvest in service recovery and other O&M functions, such as clearing trees near power lines. But there are smarter ways to pinpoint investment directly at the locations that will have the greatest impact on maintenance costs and customer experience. Identifying the right investment opportunities Bottom-up grid improvement, which builds a plan over time, can cost too much, adding more capital than a utility can effectively fund or deploy. Consequently, it is essential to determine an approach that links capital investment to improvements in reliability and cost reduction. Some utilities follow the “squeaky wheel” approach, responding to issues as they arise, or fixing the weakest circuits first. These investment patterns often add to depreciation levels, squeezing out other cost items and reducing the degrees of freedom for other important activities, like keeping lines clear of vegetation. In some cases, utilities have developed a plan for increasing reliability but are constrained by available funds, and are unable to address the prescribed needs of a sprawling geographic area. Many investments underdeliver on improvements in customer experience or reductions in cost due to their limited scale. Leading utilities recognize that traditional approaches are not as effective as they need to be, and so they have worked to understand customer requirements and their performance at a granular level, by geography and segment. They link that data to real experience, often by analyzing billions of power delivery records collected at the meters using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), as well as substation and line performance data. They can then correlate the data with the actual assets deployed (including details on make, model, age and quality) and with real data on maintenance and operations. Where utilities have done this and deployed capital efficiently (for example, in better circuit design, more undergrounding, 5 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most more solid-state sensors and switchgear), reliability has increased dramatically, as the frequency and duration of outages have decreased (see Figure 3). For example, NextEra Energy invested capital in its grid with the specific intention of boosting reliability to improve customer service, raising its position as a leader in reliability, customer satisfaction and cost position. The results of programs like these can be dramatic—improved reliability, lower costs, a better customer experience and investment of new capital in a grid that desperately needs it. Elements of a successful modernization initiative Utilities that do this well get three things right. First is a clear commitment to customer experience. Customer satisfaction levels are ultimately the benchmark against which success is measured: Is the grid reliable enough to deliver the experience that customers demand? Traditional measures of reliability on the average duration and frequency of outages across the system—including the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI) and the system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI)—ignore what a customer experiences. Metrics like the Figure 3: Identifying the most promising areas for investment, including better circuit design and burying lines underground, can help improve reliability and reduce costs per customer Note: Momentary outages are less than 2 minutes Sources: 2017 distribution reliability report, 2016–17 AMI data extract and O&M cost report for a large, integrated utility in the US Duration of outages Frequency of outages Frequency of momentary outages Distribution O&M cost per customer Minutes per customer (annual) 2017 2022–27 16%–26% Outages per customer (annual) 2017 2022–27 23%–35% Dollars per customer 2017 2022–27 8%–11% Momentary outages per customer (annual) 2017 2022–27 15%–23% 6 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most Successful initiatives require a clear understanding of the potential for improvement and the parameters of judicious investment. momentary average interruption frequency index (MAIFI) and CEMI-5 (customers experiencing more than five interruptions of a minute or more in the past year) are more relevant since they more accurately reflect the customer experience—and are therefore useful in guiding investment decisions. Investments in the grid can improve the customer experience in other ways, too, by improving transparency and providing customers with more data about their usage. Leading utilities have a clear-eyed view of these connections and plan their grid modernization programs around them. Second, senior leadership must be able and willing to ruthlessly prioritize capital investments. Utilities have to keep in mind that these investments will need to be proven out to oftenskeptical regulators. Successful initiatives require a clear understanding of the potential for improvement and the parameters of judicious investment. More than a few utilities have tried putting in place large improvement plans, only to be rebuffed by regulators who were unconvinced of the value that would accrue to customers from these investments. Finally, leaders recognize that they need to bring the right capabilities to bear. This includes a sophisticated approach to advanced analytics, often supported by partners with strengths in data engineering who can help utilities crunch the information and draw the right insights. Part of the puzzle is also to ensure an adequate supply of talent: This only works if there is enough qualified labor, both internal and contracted, to get the job done—and not only those who can operate heavy machinery and climb poles, but also those who can tap the power of automation and other new technologies. For executives eager to get started, consider four principles of action essential to any grid modernization plan. 7 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most A strategic investment plan that includes sharp analysis of customer sentiment as well as a clear understanding of the grid’s pain points is essential to a successful program. • Start with customer experience. Go beyond standard industry metrics (SAIFI, SAIDI) to understand customers’ experience with outages. Where is the tipping point at which they become detractors? • Create similar clusters of circuits. Not all parts of the system are equal. Determine how to address each part, depending on its needs and the opportunities. Find ways to improve performance differences and correlate reliability with O&M performance. • Analyze the power delivery system. Clearly identify the root causes of performance issues and areas of strength and weaknesses, including labor, assets and materials. Identify the cause of interruptions, from the high-voltage lines down to the customer feeder and back, to locate the pain points. • Develop a prioritized investment and deployment plan. Establish internal mechanisms to execute the plan, including organization structure, governance, metrics, multiyear linked capex, O&M plans and the right sourcing relationships with critical suppliers. As investor interest shifts from power generation to grid modernization, utilities have the opportunity to dramatically improve the reliability and resilience of their T&D infrastructure. With regulators keeping a close eye on investments that will increase the rate base, utility executives must be able to demonstrate the benefits of these initiatives, in terms of improved reliability, lower O&M costs and happier customers. A strategic investment plan that includes sharp analysis of customer sentiment as well as a clear understanding of the grid’s pain points is essential to a successful program. 8 Grid Modernization: Invest Where It Matters Most Shared Ambition, True Results Bain & Company is the management consulting firm that the world’s business leaders come to when they want results.

      "﻿Markets reward bold action, so rather than retreat from sustainability goals, oil and gas companies should press forward. By Peter Parry Reinventing Energy in a Crisis Peter Parry is the chairman of our global Energy & Natural Resources practice, based in Milan. Copyright © 2020 Bain & Company, Inc. All rights reserved. 1 Reinventing Energy in a Crisis At a Glance Just as oil and gas companies were beginning to make significant commitments to a net-zero carbon future, the drag on demand due to the coronavirus pandemic threatens to distract their attention and derail progress. But turning away from low-carbon goals would constitute a big mistake, even in the short term. During the crisis, investors continue to reward greener companies while showing less interest in carbon-heavy incumbents. Sector leaders can continue to demonstrate their low-carbon commitments to investors by doubling down on low-carbon investments with the best returns and shorter implementation times, such as electrifying assets and reducing the carbon output of operations. Leaders will also take the opportunity for bold action in the crisis to tune their operating models to clarify accountabilities and professionalize sustainability at the core of the business, while prioritizing investments to clean energy and low-carbon projects. As recently as the beginning of this year, oil and gas majors and other sector leaders were prominently committing to ambitious targets to decarbonize their energy portfolios. Companies found themselves under intense pressure to reduce the carbon intensity of their operations, supply chains and end products. Leaders were beginning to recognize that token investments would no longer cut it and had begun to deploy more new capital into clean energy businesses (see the Bain Brief “Rethinking Energy and Natural Resources for a Net-Zero Carbon Future”). Subsequent events have refocused everyone’s attention. As demand for oil and gas plummeted and prices crashed, many companies found themselves in an existential crisis. Most have had to slash operational costs by at least 25% and reduce 2020 capital expenditures by as much as 30%—cuts that make it extremely difficult to invest at a scale that can produce significant outcomes in carbon reduction at the pace needed. For some executives, the temptation to retreat or slow down on decarbonization commitments or execution must be very strong. Doing so, however, would constitute a strategic misstep, not only in terms of meeting long-term objectives but also for maintaining market value. Bain’s analysis of the performance of energy sector shares during the current crisis finds that companies with portfolios heavy in traditional hydrocarbon businesses initially see sharp declines, while those more assertively invested in greener fuels and low-carbon 2 Reinventing Energy in a Crisis power generation have fared much better (see Figure 1). Even as the world’s attention has focused on the coronavirus pandemic, investors have kept their attention on longer-term viability. Investors also reward decisive action during a downturn, suggesting that what may seem to be the low-risk playbook of cutting costs and retreating to the core may be the higher-risk path for oil and gas players. Analysis of oil and gas valuations over three major economic recessions during the last 25 years confirms that “wait and watch” was a poor option. Across industry sectors, companies that took bold and effective action during the 2007–08 global financial crisis performed much better than those that retreated to precrisis approaches and activities (see Figure 2). Act now Given that standing still is not an option, what should oil and gas companies be doing? The standard response might be to shelve mid- and longer-term sustainability research into initiatives that will take years to reach scale, such as large-scale hydrogen infrastructure. Energy storage and advanced biofuel feedstocks may also take a back seat, while plant electrification, carbon capture, operational decarbonization, plastics and lubricants recycling are more likely to push forward. For Figure 1: Renewables have been more resilient than oil and gas companies 0 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 Share price ($, indexed to 100 as of February 3, 2020) –2% +2% –16% S&P 500 Low carbon Oil and gas majors Notes: Low-carbon group comprises Ørsted, Neste, Iberdrola, ENEL, NextEra; oil and gas majors group comprises BP, Shell, Total, ENI, Equinor, Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips Source: Capital IQ Lower-carbon companies have made some operational changes, but no large capex cuts in response to Covid-19 … … while companies in this group have announced significant capex/opex cuts ($5B–$8B per player) since March 3 Reinventing Energy in a Crisis example, in late May, Equinor, Shell and Total made a final investment decision on their large carbon capture and storage project, Northern Lights, off Norway’s west coast. Less clear will be the scale and pace for development of low-carbon infrastructure, build-out of net-zero carbon assets, and larger- scale expansion of biofuel production and the next generation of renewable power assets (see Figure 3). Steps to pursue a zero-carbon future During the current crisis, oil and gas companies are freeing up company resources through new ways of working and lower levels of operational and capex activity. Some are diverting this expertise to initiatives that will help them reach their net-zero carbon goals. (see Figure 4). In this environment, leaders are bringing together the often fragmented and incremental sustainability efforts into a concentrated set of initiatives and establishing a transformation framework. Despite growing advocacy, initiatives and target setting, the oil and gas majors have yet to substantially reduce their Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions: Between 2014 and 2018, eight majors reduced these emissions by only 5.6% on average. The Covid-19 slowdowns in industrial and commercial activity reduced global greenhouse gas emissions by about 17% in April, but that followed a decade of annual increases. Without concerted action, emissions are certain to spike back as lockdowns relax and resume their rise, and people and companies get back to work. To change the trajectory, a bolder approach is required. Figure 2: Companies that took proactive, decisive action during a downturn saw, on average, better results in the decade that followed Growth in nominal EBIT (indexed 2007=100) 2007 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 CAGR During recession 2007–17 Took opportunities Acknowledged recession late Accelerate growth Struggle to bounce Winner Losers 14% 0% Notes: Analysis of 3,865 companies with winners n=416 and losers n=3,449; winners defined as companies whose growth in revenue, EBIT and total shareholder returns exceeded twice the industry/country average over 10 years (2007–17) Sources: Capital IQ; Bain & Company analysis of sustained value creators 4 Reinventing Energy in a Crisis Figure 3: Energy companies may need to prioritize sustainability initiatives based on their ability to deliver greater effects in less time Protect and run the business today Retool the business for the future Low Shorter Longer High Potential impact Time to implement Sources: Bain & Company; company websites Electrification Recycling Renewable power Biofuels Net-zero carbon assets Industrial green hydrogen Scale hydrogen Advanced bio feedstock Operational decarbonization Figure 4: Some oil and gas majors have announced bold, specific decarbonization targets 2023 2025 2030 2035 2040 2050 BP ENI Repsol Shell Total Install methane measurement at major oil and gas sites Invest in renewables, reach 3GW capacity Reach 5GW capacity in renewables 10% cut in carbon intensity Net-zero emissions upstream 30% cut in net carbon footprint 20% cut in carbon intensity 15% cut in carbon intensity Increase capex in low-carbon electricity to 20% Net-zero operations 40% cut in carbon intensity 35% cut in carbon intensity Net-zero operations Net-zero emissions from upstream production 50% cut in carbon intensity of sold products Net-zero operations 65% cut in net carbon footprint 80% net reduction in emissions Net-zero emissions Net-zero operations in Europe Sources: Bain & Company; company announcements and websites 5 Reinventing Energy in a Crisis • Establish a short-term sustainability roadmap. Many companies have set long-term decarbonization goals, but what’s needed now are clear, short-term action plans with discernible outcomes, which complement long-term ambitions such as net zero by 2050 or sooner, with objectives and outcomes over the next 12 months, as well as two and five years out. • Use the operating model to clarify accountabilities, encourage change and professionalize sustainability. It took many years for the oil industry to develop effective ways to deploy digital capabilities. Experimental approaches in a wide range of settings had little effect until they were prioritized, accountabilities clarified, and pilots scaled up to deliver new ways of working. Similarly, a company’s sustainability efforts may have only token effects until the operating model reflects how and where the commercial business impact is visible and where differentiated capabilities will be developed. For an oil and gas company, embedding these changes into the corporate management system captures the lessons learned from pilot programs and how they will be scaled across the organization’s operations and products. The disruptions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic preclude any simple return to a previous status quo. Many traditional sources of capital are no longer available. • Reassign investment to clean energy projects. If the initial reaction to the collapse in demand was to delay or cancel pending oil and LNG projects, the evolving thinking is to consider how we might refocus a significant proportion (40% to 50%) of that capital into cleaner or zero-carbon energy projects that can meet production, economic and sustainability goals. For example, although the International Energy Association has said that the Covid-19 crisis will, for the first time in two decades, slow growth in renewable power generation, the IEA expects growth to rebound in 2021. Some oil and gas majors are taking the lead: ENI’s chief executive, Claudio Descalzi, has committed to building 55 gigawatts of renewable energy projects and reducing its product emissions by 80% by 2050. In late May, BP’s CEO, Bernard Looney, doubled down on his company’s commitment to reducing carbon, saying the pandemic had only deepened his and the board’s commitment to sustainability. And Shell’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, has told investors that the company would toughen existing targets to reduce the company’s net carbon footprint by 65% by 2050. These statements signal a strong desire among sector leaders to seize the opportunities in this moment in order to move the energy transition forward. The disruptions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic preclude any simple return to a previous status quo. Many traditional sources of capital are no longer available. Regeneration programs of 6 Reinventing Energy in a Crisis nations and regional economic powers will give preference to greener initiatives; strings will be attached. Sector leaders who retool now for a more sustainable future will position themselves more competitively, for both funding and project approvals, ahead of those who hesitate or try to recreate the conditions that existed previously—and these are key elements in generating investment returns. The world has changed, and this is the moment to deliver sustainability gains while creating new value for the business.

Many traditional sources of capital are no longer available. • Reassign investment to clean energy projects. If the initial reaction to the collapse in demand was to delay or cancel pending oil and LNG projects, the evolving thinking is to consider how we might refocus a significant proportion (40% to 50%) of that capital into cleaner or zero-carbon energy projects that can meet production, economic and sustainability goals. For example, although the International Energy Association has said that the Covid-19 crisis will, for the first time in two decades, slow growth in renewable power generation, the IEA expects growth to rebound in 2021. Some oil and gas majors are taking the lead: ENI’s chief executive, Claudio Descalzi, has committed to building 55 gigawatts of renewable energy projects and reducing its product emissions by 80% by 2050. In late May, BP’s CEO, Bernard Looney, doubled down on his company’s commitment to reducing carbon, saying the pandemic had only deepened his and the board’s commitment to sustainability. And Shell’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, has told investors that the company would toughen existing targets to reduce the company’s net carbon footprint by 65% by 2050. These statements signal a strong desire among sector leaders to seize the opportunities in this moment in order to move the energy transition forward. The disruptions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic preclude any simple return to a previous status quo. Many traditional sources of capital are no longer available. Regeneration programs of 6 Reinventing Energy in a Crisis nations and regional economic powers will give preference to greener initiatives; strings will be attached. Sector leaders who retool now for a more sustainable future will position themselves more competitively, for both funding and project approvals, ahead of those who hesitate or try to recreate the conditions that existed previously—and these are key elements in generating investment returns. The world has changed, and this is the moment to deliver sustainability gains while creating new value for the business.

Dear Colleague: Industries in the energy and natural resources sector oil—and gas, utilities, chemicals, mining, and agriculture—face a unique and intense period of change as they navigate through the energy and resource transition. None of the old imperatives have gone away: these companies still need to produce and deliver energy, materials, food, and services, efficiently, to their demanding customers. But that’s only table stakes now. Climate change, shifting consumer preferences, demands for greater accountability, and unprecedented levels of business competition will all require new ways of working, technological breakthroughs, and leadership that can rapidly scale their deployment. Over the past two years, our work with clients in these industries has changed, with three themes emerging. • Innovation. The need to harness transformative technologies and practices to evolve their businesses will enable companies to continue to thrive while preserving the planet for future generations. • Impact. More than ever before, the ability to work with customers and other stakeholders will be critical to ensure companies maintain the social license to operate complex businesses in the heart of our communities and fragile environments. • Economics. Funding these transitions will require new levels of investor management and regulatory engagement. Companies will need to create extraordinary economic value to draw the capital and access the resources necessary to tackle these challenges. We’ve written this report, the first in a planned annual series, to share emerging insights from this work and to support all of you as we collectively tackle the world’s most important issues. We’ve taken a general manager’s perspective to help you understand the issues and what you need to know to move ahead. The report’s first chapter unpacks the issues ENR companies are facing and explains why we believe it’s essential for leaders to deliver on all three of these imperatives. The next section highlights critical trends we see underpinning the energy and resource transition, emphasizing the connections across sectors and the speed of change. We look at these challenges through a future-back, customer-oriented view of the future—a perspective our clients find more 3 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition compelling than air-fi lled forecasts of massive profi ts or doomsday prognostications. It’s also the approach we’re taking with much of our client work, because it allows us to paint the target and work with organizations to fi nd ways to reach it. In the last section, we describe a set of strategic advantages that we see industry leaders building to shape the future. Managing through the transitions will require a fundamentally diff erent approach to strategy, the operational model, and implementation priorities. Much of our work with clients focuses on building new capabilities, including operational decarbonization, second engines of growth, more effi cient capital projects, scale digital and automation, and transformed supply chains, all with the aim of becoming a strategic diff erentiator. At the same time, the traditional core businesses must continue to generate revenues to fund the transitions, as they become more sustainable, too. The energy and resource transition is likely to be a top priority for many of us for the rest of our careers. ENR leaders will drive the next wave of transformative innovation, evolve the social compact with customers and communities, and generate the capital required to create a more sustainable future. We at Bain look forward to continuing the discussion with our friends across the interconnected energy and natural resources industries. Joe Scalise Partner at Bain 4 At a Glance Over the past century, companies in the energy and natural resources sectors have helped lift billions out of poverty and made the modern consumer economy possible. Even so, many investors are betting against them in the energy transition, counting on insurgent companies with fewer legacy challenges to bring about change. But these incumbents have the capabilities to drive the energy transition at scale. To become important contributors to the essential changes, these companies need to get three things right: innovation, impact, and economics. Energy and natural resources companies are uniquely qualified to address the challenges of the world’s most important issues. By Aaron Denman, Peter Parry, and Joe Scalise Harnessing the Energy and Resource Transition 5 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition The next five years are going to be critical for the industries that supply energy and natural resources to the world’s economies. In that short span, while they keep their current businesses running, most will begin reinventing themselves as businesses that also move the world closer to a lower-carbon, sustainable future. Some investors are betting against them, shifting money from these incumbents to new companies that have less baggage and appear to be more innovative and more capable of solving the world’s most important issues. But it would be a mistake to count the incumbents out. These industries have already helped drive monumental shifts over the past century, delivering reliable and affordable energy that powers the world’s markets, supplying raw materials that make the consumer economy possible, and ensuring a steady food supply that feeds billions (see Figure 1). Even so, many energy and natural resources (ENR) companies that transformed the world are caught on the wrong side of a story line, legacy players in a sector that’s ripe for disruption. The question being asked in boardrooms is: How do we fix that? One way is to change our thinking about the role of energy and natural resources companies in this transition. The industries under the most pressure to change are the same ones that have the Figure 1: The global population has grown to nearly 8 billion, while living standards have improved dramatically and energy intensity has decreased 0 2 4 6 8 1820 1850 1900 1950 1980 2020 Global population and economic status (billion) Not in extreme poverty Living in extreme poverty 1990 0.17 2000 0.15 2010 0.13 2018 0.11 Energy intensity: Tons of oil equivalent per $1,000 of GDP Sources: Our World in Data; Population Reference Bureau; World Data Lab; Bain & Company; International Energy Agency 6 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition experience and organizations necessary to transform the world’s use of energy and resources. Their achievements underscore their unique capabilities and also serve as the foundation for their next phase of growth. It helps that the opportunities tied to the transition are compelling. Trillions of investment dollars are up for grabs, as the world rebuilds the infrastructure for a more sustainable and lower-carbon economy—renewable energy generation and greater electric grid capacity; industry and transportation that run more on electricity and hydrogen and less on fossil fuels; a circular path for consumer plastics that are more recyclable or more biodegradable; and an agriculture system that leaves a lighter footprint. The adversarial stance we’ve grown accustomed to between many stakeholders (investors, customers, community members) and these companies has accomplished what it needed to: defining the necessary changes and spurring governments and industries into action. The adversarial stance we’ve grown accustomed to between many stakeholders (investors, customers, community members) and these companies has accomplished what it needed to: defining the necessary changes and spurring governments and industries into action. The Covid-19 pandemic introduced another element to the discussion: the determination to build back better. Now is the time to work collaboratively, develop partnerships, and address the immense challenges inherent in the energy and resource transition. Under scrutiny and squeezed for capital ENR firms face two related challenges. One is that greater scrutiny from the public over sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is making it harder to obtain capital for expansion. The second is that capital is flowing to their insurgent competitors, which are disrupting these industries and beginning to take market share. Attention to the damage from ENR industries—primarily carbon and other GHG emissions—poses an existential threat to existing business models, one that’s more serious than in previous cycles of scrutiny. Weather events and wildfires are occurring more often and with greater intensity, and that’s made climate change appear more imminent to people who once saw it as a far-off threat. Many energy and natural resources firms have found ways to reduce their environmental impact 7 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition over the past few decades, as in mining, where newer techniques have made extraction more precise, with lower impact. But most of these were targeted to discrete issues, usually at a local level. Carbon emissions are more diffuse and the effects are more distributed, without a direct link to the source. Addressing them requires coordinated efforts across firms, sectors, and nations, since no single company can change the course of an entire industry. As the links to emission-intensive industries and their products become clearer, public pressure mounts and investment capital for future projects becomes more difficult to obtain. Market caps have not kept pace with other industries, and so these industries represent a smaller portion of the economy (see Figure 2). ENR firms need to find ways to respond while continuing to provide the materials and services necessary for consumers to enjoy the same level of personal consumption. Market caps have not kept pace with other industries, and so the energy and natural resource industries represent a smaller portion of the economy. Figure 2: The market cap of major energy and natural resources companies has grown in the past decade, but much less than in other industries 2010 Top 500 ENR companies Top 500 non-ENR companies $24T Today $60T 12% 206% Market capitalization Growth 2010‒today 27% 12% ENR share of total Sources: S&P Capital IQ; Financial Times; World Federation of Exchanges 8 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition 0 5 10 15 20 2011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Value of venture capital deals ($B) Low-carbon transport Renewables Energy efficiency Energy storage and hydrogen Other low-carbon Conventional fuels Source: International Energy Agency Figure 3: Over the past 6 years, venture capital has shifted from renewables to low-carbon transport At the same time, these firms must meet the needs of investors who control the price and flow of capital. The last decade has seen equity investors shift capital away from energy and natural resources firms and into technology, a sign that they lack confidence in the sector’s ability to adapt to changing demands (see Figure 3). Restrictions on where and how capital can be deployed complicate this challenge. Funds focused on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) objectives have grown (see Figure 4). By April 2021, BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and 84 other fund managers had committed $37 trillion of assets to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, calling for net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. These firms can use their voting power to push proposals calling for meaningful changes. Banks and other financial institutions are also more reluctant to finance or insure assets or companies that aren’t sustainable. JP Morgan Chase, for example, has said it would begin to measure the carbon intensity of its clients and use its influence to urge them toward more sustainable businesses. For ENR companies to maintain their access to capital markets and thrive over the next few decades, they’ll need to show they can profitably execute a robust, multifaceted vision of global sustainability. 9 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Innovation, impact, and economics Progress over the next five years will set the course. Incumbent players in energy and natural resources will either become leaders or continue to lose the public’s faith and the support of the capital markets. Companies are showing early signs of effectively making the transition when they get three things right: innovation, impact, and economics. Innovation. Energy and resource firms are constantly innovating to create changes in society and markets, such as improving extraction methods to draw more hydrocarbons out of stubborn rock or developing more sophisticated plastics to replace heavier and more resource-intensive materials in vehicles. Now they’re investing in innovation that will change their operations, supply chains, and products, moving toward a more sustainable, lower-carbon future. In some cases, they’re fast followers of insurgents that have pioneered new techniques and technologies that could threaten existing business models. In other cases, they’re developing their own innovations. In Finland, refiner and chemical producer Neste has invested in innovative technologies and business lines to become the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel fuel. More than a decade ago, Neste’s leadership recognized the mounting risks of depending on traditional petroleum products as the fuel source of the future. Predictions of peak oil weren’t just academic; they spelled the end of Figure 4: More money is flowing through ESG funds 0 50 100 150 200 Q1 2019 Q2 19 Q3 19 Q4 19 Q1 20 Q2 20 Q3 20 Q4 20 Q1 21 Net additions to global sustantainable funds ($B) US Europe Rest of World Note: ESG refers to environmental, social, and corporate governance Source: Morningstar Direct, as of March 2021 10 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Sources: Company reports; Bain & Company Comparable operating profit by segment (€M) 2,000 1,500 1,000 2011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 500 0 -100 Value creation 2011 Market capitalization P/E ratio Other 7 44 $5B $38B 2021 Oil retail services Oil products Renewable products Figure 5: Most of Neste’s profits come from renewable products growth. In response, the company invested in technologies to produce diesel from renewable sources. Renewable diesel now furnishes most of Neste’s profits, but its eightfold increase in market valuation over the past decade results not only from this major new business line, but from other prospects stemming from it, including alternative aviation fuels (see Figure 5). Impact. Pressure is increasing on nearly every company to reevaluate its role in the local and global communities, and to become better corporate citizens. For ENR firms, most of the scrutiny focuses on emissions and other ESG issues like water use, waste, recycling, and transparency. In the long term, however, they’re likely to be judged on a broader scorecard that includes their impact on native lands, environmental justice, and issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Most will need to retrain their workforces for a more automated future. To navigate this transition, ENR leadership teams must work with investors, customers, and communities to ensure they maintain the social license required to operate complex businesses in the world’s most vulnerable places. 11 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition In Denmark, the state oil and natural gas company, Dansk Olie og Naturgas, found that shareholders, customers, and other citizens were increasingly hostile to large carbon emitters, putting its long-term existence in doubt. In the first decade of the 2000s, after having already increased its presence in power generation and distribution, its leaders adopted a climate strategy that eventually led it to recapitalize the company, divest its oil and gas assets, and invest heavily in wind farms. Now rebranded as Ørsted, the company is a global leader in renewable energy delivery, with nearly all of its profits from wind (see Figure 6). Economics. You can’t change the world if you can’t fund the change. But forming the capital for new investments in the energy and resource transition increasingly requires not just hitting your marks on performance and earnings, but also telling a credible investor story, showing real leadership and the potential to create new value. Figure 6: Ørsted’s core business has recentered on offshore wind farming Sources: Company reports; Bain & Company Operating profit ($M) 4,000 2,000 2009 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 0 -2,000 Value creation 2017 Market capitalization P/E ratio 21 33 $25B $59B 2021 Bioenergy and markets Oil and gas Customer solutions Corporate, other, and adjustments Offshore Onshore 12 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition The six largest banks in the US have pledged to provide financing only to zero-carbon projects by 2050. Meanwhile, the funding and underwriting bars are rising. The six largest banks in the US have pledged to provide financing only to zero-carbon projects by 2050, and combined they have set aside trillions of dollars to fund green projects. Major insurers have balked at underwriting coal projects, and coal companies are reporting higher debt costs. Oil sands players in Alberta are also reporting challenges getting insurance. With more reporting requirements related to climate risk, and more discussions about stranded costs, the challenges in forming capital in fossil fuels will continue to grow. However, the energy and resource transition can also be a real opportunity for those willing to embrace it. Duke Energy, a large multistate utility in the southeastern US, has improved its operational performance and announced the largest power generation transition in the country. This transition, which will reduce Duke’s active coal units by 50% to 70% by 2030, is an important component of a $124 billion to $134 billion capital plan for 2021 to 2029. Duke’s announcement, accompanied by an ESG Investor Day and a higher rate of growth for earnings, helped drive share prices from the mid-$80s in May 2020 to more than $100 in May 2021. So far, Neste, Ørsted, and Duke Energy are among the exceptions. Few other companies have moved quite so assertively to confront these issues. It’s worth noting that the fast movers play in industries where the externalities are most obvious and the threats to success seem most imminent: energy and power generation. But others aren’t immune. In agriculture, for example, the popularity of Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger have spurred nearly every major food company to invest in alternative proteins. While there’s no repeatable blueprint, we’re already seeing patterns that can set companies up for success. Firms with steady core businesses are using revenues to invest in second engines of growth, new lines that make good use of their capabilities while tapping into new markets. Others with products that remain in high demand are investing in R&D and product development that will allow them to continue selling into growth markets while reducing emissions or other harmful effects. And nearly every firm is developing a roadmap for achieving the ambitious sustainability goals that most have announced in recent years. 13 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition We wrote this report to share what we’re seeing in the marketplace and to show what some companies are doing to make the most of it. The first section describes some of the important trends affecting energy and resource companies today: • Public-private cooperation in climate policy • Other, nonenergy transitions that are occurring • Redesigning the value chain to meet consumers’ evolving preferences • The need for a more collaborative relationship between ESG investors and ENR firms • Early business cases for hydrogen The second section outlines some important tools and capabilities to help manage these transitions, equipping executives with: • More effective methods for managing capital projects • Ways to measure operations and supply chains on more parameters than just cost efficiency • Strategies for developing an Engine 2 of growth • A four-step process for accelerating the journey to net zero • Digital technology’s role in freeing up capital for investment in the energy transition The task ahead may appear daunting, even for the most capable energy or natural resources executive. But the tools to thrive in this period of rapid change—the capabilities to innovate, an understanding of the impact on shareholders and communities, and the ambition to pursue the economic opportunities inherent in the transitions—are all within reach. Those who continue to deliver on their current business while developing longer-term plans will be the ones who turn an existential threat into the opportunity of a generation.

While discussions about reaching those goals deals largely with abatement curves and net-zero studies, the actual steps to get there have more to do with raising capital and reducing risk. One model for public-private cooperation to reduce risk is Denmark’s climate partnerships, in which policymakers and companies share responsibility for moving toward net zero. In Denmark, a partnership between government and the private sector offers a model for successful collaboration on decarbonization. By Thomas Arentsen, Alessandro Cadei, Grant Dougans, and António Farinha Critical Trends of the Energy and Natural Resources Transition Net Zero: From Political Goals to Industry Action 17 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Over the past few years, most of the world’s large economies have set targets of reaching net-zero carbon emissions over the next 30 to 40 years. To achieve these ambitious goals, investments in green technology are ramping up quickly and could surpass conventional energy investments in 5 to 10 years. It’s an impressive shift, but one that’s still too slow to meet the Paris Agreement’s goals of keeping the rise in temperature below 2.0°C in this century—unless the private and public sectors learn to work more collaboratively to encourage capital investment and reduce risk. The roadmap to reach net-zero emissions is clear, and we can think of it in terms of four categories, each comprising a range of actions. • Consume less energy. Reduce waste in buildings and industrial settings, and make appliances and the electricity grid more efficient. • Decarbonize or electrify. Switch from internal combustion engines to cars and trucks that run on electricity or other low-carbon fuels. Electrify heating and industrial systems. • Green the electricity supply. Build more renewable power generation and other zero-carbon sources of energy and capacity. • Capture and store carbon. Build systems that capture CO2 and other greenhouse gases during production and directly from the atmosphere. Preserve and enhance natural carbon sinks, such as forests. To make this happen, electric grids need to be updated, gas and district heating systems will change, and energy consumers have to embrace new technologies. Electrification will play an important role, but it won’t be enough on its own. Fuels from low-carbon hydrogen need to be developed to meet some transportation and industrial needs (see “Business Opportunities in Low-Carbon Hydrogen.”) By some estimates, $50 trillion will be invested over the next 30 years in renewable energy, hydrogen, electrification, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, and infrastructure to support it all. Much of the discussion on reducing emissions focuses on abatement curves and net-zero studies. While these help countries and industries think about where they have to go, getting there has more to do with encouraging capital and reducing risk. A look at nonagricultural emissions in the European Union through the lens of capital intensity and complexity shows where some of the big opportunities are, and where the private sector probably needs more support to reduce the risk of large investments (see Figure 1). In some sectors, such as power generation, the technology to reduce emissions is already well known, and the required capital investment is within reach for much of the private sector, given the right policy constructs and pricing mechanisms. However, in other sectors, where the complexity and costs remain high, such as transportation and industrial processes, managing risks will require public and private partnerships. While the steps are clear, what’s missing is a unified approach among industry, policymakers, customers, and capital to move the world from lofty ambitions to real climate action. 18 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Denmark’s national collaboration model One model taking shape in Denmark shows how the government and the private sector can work together to promote capital formation, foster innovation, and share risks in order to move closer to that country’s goal of reducing emissions to 70% of 1990 levels by 2030, and net zero by 2050. In the Danish government’s climate partnerships, policymakers provide the framework and conditions, while business contributes its expertise and the investment in new technology and infrastructure to meet the country’s climate ambitions. The partnerships include energy companies in oil and gas and renewables (both utilities and original equipment manufacturers in wind, solar, biogas, and hydrogen), and companies along the grid, including transmission, distribution, and retail. The initial work has set ambitious goals for 2030, including reducing carbon emissions from the energy and utilities sector by at least 95%; cutting fossil fuel use in buildings, transportation, and industry by 50%; and developing a 10-year roadmap for hydrogen fuels. In the partnerships’ work, risk sharing emerged as an important topic. Because energy companies invest heavily in infrastructure and generation, which often take decades to repay and are designed Figure 1: Power generation offers the greatest potential for rapidly reducing Europe’s CO2 emissions, while some transportation and industrial processes will require more support Notes: Emissions measured within European Union; doesn’t include agriculture.

But altering consumption habits can be difficult. Prices of fossil fuels and other energy sources will help guide some changes, but for others, incentives, subsidies, and regulations may be necessary. To reach Denmark’s target of reducing carbon emissions to 70% of 1990 levels by 2030, the country would need to generate twice as much electricity as it does today, which would require significant investments in renewable energy production and infrastructure, along with investments in new technology by industry. An analysis by Bain and the Danish Energy Association found that the country could completely phase out fossil fuels in electricity and heating, delivering clean energy to industry, agriculture, and transport. The partnership provided a way for business and government to speed up progress toward net zero by combining strengths. One of the partners is Danish energy company Ørsted, whose group CEO, Mads Nipper, highlighted the need for political and business collaboration. “Fixing climate change is not a technology problem,” he said. “We pretty much know the solutions to do it, and there is plenty of financial capital available. But we have a leadership problem, and it’s becoming increasingly important for business executives to take on the role as key influencers in shaping policies and national climate actions.” The partnership provided a way for business and government to speed up progress toward net zero by combining strengths. In the initial phase, the government gave up some control to business executives, which created trust and ownership in the business community. “This work could never have been completed effectively by government alone, and would not have succeeded without the acknowledgment of all participants of their responsibility for the outcome,” said Lars Aagaard, CEO of the Danish Energy Association. Denmark has taken important steps toward realizing its politically determined climate targets through actions that haven’t scared off the business community. Building on the work of the partnerships, the government approved laws aimed at bringing Denmark a third of the way to its 2030 targets. Executives have been able to create a productive alliance with government that looks at opportunities and threats to achieving the country’s climate goals in a balanced way, and with regulatory tools that support new business opportunities. 20 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Unlocking the net-zero opportunity For energy and natural resources companies, the key to this level of cooperation is improving the way they work with stakeholders and policymakers. Even small policy decisions can have multibillion-dollar effects on a large company’s energy transition. Policymakers, business leaders, and other stakeholders have to get better at resolving disputes, sharing risk, and clarifying the rules of the road—which all will be important in allowing companies to obtain the capital needed to invest in new technology. These dialogues and perspectives need to make their way into and across energy and natural resources organizations. Adopting the stakeholder view can’t be left to the regulatory or legislative affairs teams; it must be a fundamental consideration that influences decisions about capital planning, operations, R&D, and product development. That’s the surest way to guard against company silos continuing to conduct business as usual while stakeholders and policy makers push the company in a different direction. Everyone should be aware that the stakeholder landscape is changing and understand their role in navigating it. Collaborating closely with stakeholders is but one of the transformations required of executives at energy and natural resources companies. These executives can think about five imperatives to help capture new opportunities and move toward net zero. • Make the shift to green technologies, whether from fossil to renewables, or from analog to digital. • Shape the stakeholder landscape to create constructive policies and remove impediments to capital deployment. • Engage actively with customers to capture their interest in green products, and to enlist their help in decarbonizing and reducing energy use. • Prepare for new levels of capital deployment and scrutiny, from major capital projects to programmatic investments. • Make sure corporate culture and processes are ready for the net-zero transition, including leadership and cultural norms, management systems, structure, accountabilities, talent strategy, and business processes. Unlike in digital, where companies often set up use case factories to accelerate progress, this transformation must be deeply felt and embedded throughout the organization, with every employee— and the hard work of getting underway should start now. 21 Energy and natural resources companies are responding to seismic changes in transportation, plastic, and how we grow and consume food. By Jayant Gotpagar, Fernando Martins, Peter Meijer, and Mark Porter Critical Trends of the Energy and Natural Resources Transition Energy Is Only One Part of the Sustainability Transition At a Glance In addition to changes in energy, companies are managing other large transitions that will affect their core businesses and offer new paths for growth. The shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles affects not only automakers and energy companies, but chemical, mining, and agriculture companies as well. Chemical producers must respond to the global push to reduce plastic waste. Bio-based polymers can produce plastics with fewer emissions, while other innovations will create more recyclable or biodegradable products. In agriculture, fertilizer is coming under scrutiny for its emissions, and agribusinesses are addressing consumers’ changing diets, including alternatives to meat. 22 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition The energy transition is already roiling the energy and natural resources (ENR) sectors, affecting long-term strategic planning, investments in infrastructure and equipment, allocation of resources, and so much more. But this isn’t the only resource transition that ENR companies are dealing with. Several others are in motion, aimed at reducing waste and improving the circularity of supply and production chains, and developing a more sustainable food supply to feed a growing population. Like the energy transition, these will transform the way ENR companies do business—and executives will have to adapt their business strategies and operating models in order to thrive. These transitions all reflect shifting attitudes about the roles of industry, government, and consumers in managing resources. Consumers and shareholders are, increasingly, demanding change and accountability. As companies react, profit pools are bound to shift, and executives will want to identify these trends before they happen. Leading companies will need to balance the needs of their existing core business while building new sources of growth. To succeed in their new lines of business, they’ll have to identify customers’ evolving needs and develop a differentiated position that addresses them. Some of their bets will be large, others small, and not all will pay off. To fund these second engines of growth, leaders will often reduce the costs of existing operations while making necessary improvements to the operating model, deploying innovations in operations and products. To help develop a better understanding of these transitions, Bain looked at four that are underway: The shift to electric vehicles (EVs). Much has been written about the effect of EVs on the oil industry and renewables, but the chemical, mining, and agriculture sectors are also adapting. Ending plastic waste. Chemical makers and other companies in the industrial and consumer sectors will have to work together to improve the circularity of plastic and reduce pollution. Decarbonizing the fertilizer chain. A price on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and rising demand for ammonia in other applications such as marine fuel will increase the cost of fertilizer, setting off a chain reaction through the chemical and agricultural sectors. Responding to a changing diet. As more consumers adopt diets with less meat, the agricultural industry is investing in alternative proteins. From vehicle exhausts to batteries, from platinum to lithium The transition from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to electric vehicles is causing ripple effects across supply chains and into the chemicals, mining, and agribusiness sectors (see Figure 1). 23 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition In chemicals, volumes may have peaked for the exhaust systems used in ICEs, which rely on chemical catalysts. Until now, stringent regulations have required automakers to use more chemical catalysts, resulting in a higher value per average vehicle. In fact, the total value of chemical catalysts in exhaust systems grew 7% per year since 2010. Over the coming five years, however, growth is expected to slow to 2% per year, and the global market may shrink afterwards. This gloomy outlook has pushed the leading material suppliers—BASF, Johnson Matthey, and Umicore, which supply more than 90% of the market—to invest heavily in innovation by developing materials that will be needed for future power trains. These investments include cathode-active materials for batteries, which account for more than 30% of the battery’s cost, and membranes for fuel cells. This pivot taps capabilities that suppliers already have, including fine metals chemistry and relationships with the automakers. They also must develop new muscles to succeed in markets with greater competitive intensity, faster development cycles (battery costs per kWh fell by more than 85% from 2010 to 2019), and large capital investment demands, around $1 billion for a scale factory. It also disrupts traditional, linear value chains and requires greater flexibility to work in constantly changing partnerships with more companies. 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 0 10 20 30 40% 2017 20 25 30 35 40 Light vehicles worldwide, by drive train (billion) Battery electric vehicle share Internal combustion engines (ICE), including hybrid electric Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles Battery electric vehicles Percentage of cars that are battery EVs Peak ICE Source: Bain EV market model Figure 1: Internal combustion engines could peak by 2028, as battery electric vehicles grow to 35% of the global fleet by 2040 24 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Mining companies will also be affected. The exhaust systems on ICE vehicles are the main market for the platinum group metals (PGMs), and while they’re also used in fuel cells, the market for fuel-cell EVs isn’t expected to be as large, resulting in less demand for PGMs in autos. As old ICEs are scrapped, their PGMs will be recycled. The net effect will be less demand for virgin PGMs, forcing mining companies to adjust. On the other hand, more batteries will mean greater demand for nickel, lithium, and cobalt, with an average 60 kWh battery needing about 90 kilograms of these metals. As demand rises, so will prices of these metals. Miners need to figure out their transition from a strong position in PGM mines to a new position of strength, for example, increasing their access to mines that produce cobalt or rare earth minerals, with an eye to maximizing the value of their investments. The ripples spread further. Corn farmers in the US Midwest will feel the pinch because about 40% of all US corn becomes ethanol, which is blended at about 10% into gasoline. Our baseline EV penetration curve implies a reduction of 45% in corn tonnage requirements for ethanol in the US alone. Much of that prime cropland could switch to crops that require fewer inputs, creating other ripple effects for suppliers and retailers. In addition, some of the world’s ethanol mills could become stranded assets. Changing how we create, use, and discard plastics Plastics have come under increasing scrutiny due to the increase of plastic waste, which has created huge environmental challenges. However, many of the alternatives to plastic (including paper) can increase carbon emissions as much as five times. Plastic packaging also helps to extend the shelf life of perishable food, thereby reducing food waste, which is another major contributor to carbon emissions. Optimizing both waste and emissions involves complex trade-offs that are amplified as environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) targets for producers and customers of plastics become more ambitious. There’s no silver bullet, of course. For each product or process, multiple solutions exist, each requiring trade-offs on product and environmental performance. Ultimately, we’ll have to change how we create, use, and discard plastics, and that will require innovations in technology and business models. This starts by understanding consumer needs for individual applications and finding the right alternatives to meet them. The solutions will combine ways to reduce the use of plastics where the application isn’t critical, replacing some of today’s plastics with bio-based or biodegradable plastics, improving recycling, and introducing alternative materials. 25 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Carbon emissions (indexed to fossil-based polymer production) Low-carbon polymer 0.2 Fossil-based polymer production 1.0 0.9 Polymer production from biomass –0.7 Biomass production and cullulose conversion Notes: Polymer life-cycle analysis based on kilograms of CO2 emitted per kilograms of polymer produced; negative emissions represent use of biomass material that would otherwise go to waste, decompose, and release methane; polymer production from biomass produces less carbon across the entire process than polymer production from petroleum-based feedstock; carbon measurement and accounting methods aren’t yet standardized, so others’ findings may differ Source: Bain & Company Figure 2: Low-carbon, bio-based polymers emit significantly less carbon than polymers made from fossil-fuel feedstock Producers of plastics are aiming to develop materials that are more recyclable and emit less carbon over their life cycle. Producers of plastics are aiming to develop materials that are more recyclable and emit less carbon over their life cycle. The accounting for reductions in emissions isn’t yet standardized, but compared with virgin materials, recycling appears to emit less emissions during production and avoids emissions from products that end up in landfills. At the same time, packaging companies, retailers, and consumer products companies are designing products and packaging to improve traceability, compliance, and labeling of recycled content. Bio-based plastics, which are made entirely or partly from renewable biological materials, are a solution that primarily addresses plastic process emissions. By using renewable biomass, which would otherwise decompose to produce methane (a powerful greenhouse gas), the life-cycle emission for a bio-based polymer can be reduced by 80% or more (see Figure 2), or even end up negative. Another approach is to combine hydrogen (made with renewable energy) with carbon dioxide to 26 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition produce simple hydrocarbons that can then be turned into plastic—again creating a carbonnegative material. Tackling the problem of plastic waste and emissions will also create new opportunities. Waste collection, sorting, and recycling requires major investment and technological innovation. Given the scarcity of high-quality plastic waste as feedstock for recycling, those who identify and develop markets for recycled materials will have a first-mover advantage. New profit pools may open up with market entrants, customers, and applications that draw investments to build scale and support a more circular value chain. Companies will need to continue shrinking costs in the core resin business to stay competitive and enable investments in new solutions. Since no one player can solve these crises alone, plastics producers, converters, and brand owners need to think beyond the boundaries of their traditional value chain. Some will view sustainability as a limited action plan, but long-term winners will embrace sustainability as integral to their strategy, building on their strengths and finding partners with complementary capabilities. Redefining the fertilizer chain The production and use of fertilizer create about 2.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilizer producers and growers have several options to mitigate emissions, including low-carbon feedstock (using ammonia made with blue or green hydrogen), shifting from commodity fertilizers to specialty NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) compounds and nitrates with more sophisticated dosages, deploying specialized seeds, switching to organic fertilizer, and adopting regenerative agriculture practices. Governments may be cautious about prioritizing these emission reductions if they’ll increase food costs for consumers. These alternatives add cost, and it’s not clear how quickly growers will shift to lower-carbon alternatives. Governments may be cautious about prioritizing these emission reductions if they’ll increase food costs for consumers. But eventually these shifts are likely to materialize, and demand will slow for commodity fertilizer producers. Other changes will also disrupt business models and profit pools. Feedstock competitiveness could shift from regions with cheap natural gas to those with cheap renewable energy when green hydrogen becomes a bigger part of the supply. Specialty fertilizers will demand more customization and integration with customers. And the industry’s by-product revenues could erode as production processes change, reducing the supply of secondary products such as diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) or CO2 , 27 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition 0 20 40 60 80 100% Daily calories consumed, per capita Grains and starches Fats, oils, and sugars Other Fruits and vegetables Meat Dairy and eggs Greenhouse gas emissions from food production Grains and starches Fats, oils, and sugars Meat Dairy and eggs Other Fruits and vegetables Note: Annual global emissions from food production total 7.2 gigatons of CO2 equivalent Sources: Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database; UNESCO; Bain & Company Figure 3: Meat and dairy are a small part of global food consumption, but emit about 80% of the greenhouse gases from food production which is often sold off today. Emerging demand for ammonia as a zero-carbon shipping fuel may provide growth opportunities for companies that make ammonia-based fertilizers. Leading fertilizer producers are preparing for change, identifying their future positions in the commodity fertilizer market and determining what they need to do to continue delivering attractive returns. For most, this means reducing costs while investing in new products like specialty fertilizers. Their market and sustainability ambitions will inform these decisions. Finding ways to build on their current capabilities in production, logistics, and innovation will help them balance their progress in new growth areas with their current business in commodity fertilizer. Responding to a changing diet About 20% of all nutritional and caloric needs globally come from land-based animal protein sources: meats, eggs, and dairy products. Proteins are associated with healthy nutrition, growth, and balanced diets, and most governmental nutritional guidelines around the world encourage significant protein in diets. Yet those land-based animal proteins also take a toll on resources, accounting for about 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture and 80% of all food-related GHG emissions worldwide (see Figure 3). They use about one-fourth of the water and 80% of the land dedicated to food production. 28 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Innovations in protein production and consumer packaging could reduce that resource intensity over time. Four lines of technology are particularly promising because they all deliver taste and texture similar to current proteins, and could cost about the same as the real thing in 5 to 10 years: • plant-based dairy and meat alternatives, building on food technologies that have existed for a few decades, such as protein isolation and extrusion; • precision fermentation of selected proteins in milk and meat, to enhance the taste and texture of the plant-based milks and meats; • cultivation of tissue cells (or cellular protein agriculture), getting animal tissue cells to replicate, grow, and specialize in bioreactors; and • mycelium fungus to simulate meat, especially pork or beef cuts. The future of protein will probably combine these technologies, and as they become more costcompetitive, they may replace 15% to 35% of animal protein in the US by 2030 to 2035. Awareness of plant-based alternatives to meat has never been higher, following the successful introduction of several popular consumer brands. Precision fermentation should increase their appeal. Over time, cell cultivation will deliver ground-meat products nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. If mycelium and other materials prove adequate as scaffolding for cultivated cells, the disruption to protein will be even greater. These technologies are undoubtedly a threat to incumbents, but also present an opportunity to tap a bigger pool of consumers and increase product innovation while reducing costs and resource footprints. Protein players have taken notice. Tyson Foods in North America and Fonterra in New Zealand have taken equity positions in promising insurgents in alternative meats and dairy. JBS, BRF Global, Vion Food Group, and Marfrig (in partnership with ADM) have developed or launched product lines. Kellogg’s and Kraft Heinz in the US have launched product lines and brands or are pivoting existing ones. Some other dairy and meat companies are heading the other way, proudly retrenching into the higher-end segments of the core protein market where, they believe, demand will remain strong for things like grass-fed Angus beef, cage-free eggs, organic beef and dairy, high-fat and high-protein yogurts, and artisan cheeses. These companies and other incumbents should consider how to integrate new technologies into their core businesses. If, in the future, consumers get clean, safe meat from vats and reactors, an intermediate step will see old and new technologies coexisting, sometimes in the same facility. Bringing the investments and capabilities to scale production of alternative proteins will help the industry accelerate the resource transition, and help early adopters establish a foothold with key customers in the food and retail industries. 29 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition How to act For every company, balancing the needs of the current business while investing in innovation and new product lines will become a key strategic task. Five actions can help executives get started. • Develop a perspective on existing profit pools and your path to new ones. • Move quickly to gain experience and build a leading position before the rest of the market catches up. Partnering with other companies along the value chain can speed up this process and fill capability gaps. • Develop the commercial proposition for customers’ evolving needs and determine which changes you need. • Align your operations, including purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing, and planning, to meet new customer demands. • Update the way teams work in your company, emphasizing the need for more cross-functional coordination, and adjusting resource allocation to consider both long-term priorities and shortterm demands. Managing these priorities over what could take decades may feel overwhelming. The best way to get started is to clearly define long-term goals, root out the new opportunities, and begin building the muscles necessary to capture them. 30 The companies that know their customers best aren’t always the companies that need to change the way food and products are developed. By Sasha Duchnowski and Jessica Snow-Wasserman Critical Trends of the Energy and Natural Resources Transition Redesigning Value Chains to Deliver More Sustainable Goods At a Glance Consumers are becoming more willing to pay a little extra—usually 5% to 10% more—for food and other products that meet their requirements on social responsibility, inclusiveness, or environmental impact. This presents an opportunity for companies that can develop and sell sustainable products at a premium within that range. A 10% increase in the cost of sustainably raised wheat would add only a few cents to the price per loaf of bread. However, the companies that know the customer best—retailers and brands—aren’t always equipped to address consumers’ concerns without cooperation from upstream partners. Companies are rethinking the value chain, developing closer partnerships upstream and downstream, so that all can better understand and meet the needs of customers. 31 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition In discussions about making food and other input materials more sustainable, the fists banging the table have been forceful, but consumers have been more tepid in their response, mostly unwilling to pay for greener products. That’s beginning to change: Nielsen research finds that 81% of consumers worldwide feel strongly that companies should improve the environment, with the feelings strongest among Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z, and shared to a lesser extent by older consumers. And they’re walking the walk: A study by Sogeti Cap Gemini reports that 79% of consumers are changing purchase preferences based on social responsibility, inclusiveness, or environmental impact. This is a big opportunity for food and other consumer product companies because this commitment suggests that customers will pay more for products that meet their requirements—although usually only 5% to 10% more. In some cases, that would be enough. If farmers could charge 10% more for wheat, they could invest that money in more sustainable practices, and the extra cost would increase the price of a $2 loaf of bread by only a penny (see Figure 1). The math is similar in packaging, which usually makes up about 10% of the cost of a product. Even a 50% increase in packaging cost, for example to cover the use of recycled plastic, would increase the total product cost by only 5%— within the range of what consumers say they’ll pay for greener products. Farmers 5% Ingredient processors/traders 5 Food processors 60 Retailer 30 End price to consumer 100 Share of the cost for a loaf of bread Sources: US Department of Agriculture; The Retail Owners Institute: Bain & Company Figure 1: Farmers could invest in greater sustainability and be paid more, without significantly raising the price of the end product 32 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition However, the companies that sell directly to customers are usually several levels removed from the growers and manufacturers that could make the changes consumers want. For example: • Growers are fragmented and focused on meeting product specifications that give them access to local and global markets. Most adopt new practices only if they lower costs or help them create a more premium product. • Processors are focused on reducing costs by growing bigger and standardizing outputs. • Brands want to reduce the cost per unit and may not fully understand the upstream challenges in greening products. How can companies work together to deliver more sustainable products at prices that consumers are still willing to pay? In the past, consumer product and food companies have tailored their products to changing customer preferences, often to reduce prices or make products more convenient. Today’s challenge is different: How can companies work together to deliver more sustainable products at prices that consumers are still willing to pay? Successfully redesigning the value chain Change is always hard in big companies, especially in sustainability. Bain’s 2018 study of nearly 300 sustainability-driven change efforts paints a stark picture. Only 4% of sustainability programs achieved their full ambitions, 49% achieved diluted results, and the rest were acknowledged as failures. How can companies beat those odds? In our work with companies redesigning value chain dynamics, we’ve noticed three factors that appear to increase the chances of improving sustainability in their value chains. It starts with getting a better understanding of what customers want to buy this week and next year. Consumer brands and retailers are closest to customers, and more likely to understand their preferences. But to make the equation work, they need to work closely with suppliers and other partners across the value chain to communicate those preferences and innovate collaboratively to come up with new products and packaging. For example, while food and beverage companies have always partnered closely with packaging companies, we’re seeing better coordination now, as both sides develop packaging that appeal to 33 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition customers who want to see less waste. The result is lots of innovation in things like recyclable food trays for produce, recyclable coffee cups, and even refillable soda bottles—an old idea that’s come round again. Coca-Cola has been investing in upstream suppliers to improve its plastic recycling capabilities. In 2019, Coca-Cola worked with a recycling technology firm, Ioniqa Technologies, and one of its packaging suppliers, Indorama Ventures, to develop a bottle made with 25% plastic recovered from the seas. A second factor is that companies will move up or down the value chain if they think it will help them meet customer demand. In beer, for example, brewers sometimes take control of hop production, either directly or through contracts, to maintain access to supply and quality of this integral ingredient. In plastics, to scale up recycling, producers will need a reliable supply of used plastic for feedstock. For example, in 2020, renewable diesel leader Neste of Finland and Unilever teamed up with Recycling Technologies to develop a program to ensure a more robust supply of feedstock for plastics recycling programs in the UK. Recycling Technologies turns the plastic waste into an oil that it delivers to Neste, which analyzes it and upgrades it into feedstock for new, virginquality plastics. Unilever brings its insight on customer preferences and its expertise on packaging design to the program. Finally, everyone will need an incentive to change behavior. The benefits of sustainability, including premiums charged for it, have to be shared across the value chain. The Nature Conservancy worked with tuna suppliers in the western and central Pacific to create a seafood company, Pacific Island Tuna Provisions, that has end-to-end control to ensure sustainable practices, including reducing bycatch of other species. One of the company’s goals is to improve socioeconomic conditions among the Pacific Island communities that rely on sales of tuna. With electronic monitoring of its sustainable fishing practices, the company offers retailers and customers high visibility into its supply chain practices to ensure that it’s following sustainable principles, in exchange for longterm, mutually beneficial supply contracts. The benefits of sustainability, including premiums charged for it, have to be shared across the value chain. 34 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Taking action If understanding the customer is the first principle in redesigning the value chain, a close second is figuring out future profit pools. As food and product companies respond to demand changes, how will that disrupt the value chain, and who will be the new winners? Teasing out scenarios can help companies uncover new business opportunities. In some cases, companies will be able to act alone to seize a competitive advantage. But since sustainability is such a large issue, some of these changes will require industrywide coordinated action. For example, organizations like the Alliance to End Plastic Waste bring together consumer product companies, chemical manufacturers, energy providers, and technology firms to work on systemic solutions to the issues of plastic waste and recycling. It will take breakthrough, innovative thinking and a mentality geared toward innovation and experimentation to pull this off. Some of the most forward-thinking and innovative companies are up to the challenge but have a long way to go. The opportunities are out there, and the urgency to act continues to grow. 35 Companies and investment funds are more likely to achieve their ambitious goals if they work closer together. By Peter Parry and Joe Scalise Time for ESG Investors and Energy and Natural Resources Companies to Work Together Critical Trends of the Energy and Natural Resources Transition At a Glance More capital is flowing into funds that invest according to principles of environmental and social responsibility, and good governance. It’s becoming increasingly important for energy and natural resources companies to provide investor propositions that allow them to tap those funds. The activism of ESG investors has helped executives grasp the scale and urgency of issues related to climate change, kick-starting the response. Now it may be time for ESG investors and energy and natural resources companies to work together to accomplish their common goals. Although these companies have the experience and capabilities to drive the energy transition at industrial scale, they’ll struggle to do so if they’re poorly funded. 36 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Market capitalization of investment in largest companies in each sector by quartile Funds that have passed more climate resolutions ... ... have smaller holdings in ENR sectors Support for climate-related proposals by 48 major funds in 2018 100% of proposals Average Utilities Agriculture Chemicals Mining Oil and gas Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 0 20 40 60 80 4 19 93% Average 74% Average 53% Average 22% 23 128 17 25 142 11 12 45 12 20 22 25 48 174 $16B 6 2 17 3 34 Notes: Analysis of proxy voting of a sample of 48 major funds in 2021; shareholding shown where stake is more than 0.5% and rounded to the nearest percent; market cap of investment as of May 2021. Sources: Ceres, S&P Global Capital IQ; company reports and websites; Bain & Company Figure 1: Institutional investors that have approved more climate proposals hold smaller investments in energy and natural resources Energy and natural resources (ENR) companies have had a bumpy ride with ESG investors over the past few years. Capital is lining up behind ESG funds, which focus on promoting principles of environmental and social responsibility, and good governance. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers group recently highlighted 87 funds with close to $37 trillion in assets, and some investors have taken high-profile advocacy positions. Bain’s analysis finds that funds with more climate resolutions tend to have smaller holdings in ENR sectors (see Figure 1). Relations between ENR companies and ESG investors have become strained, particularly on issues of carbon emissions and climate change. Shareholder pressure to set climate targets, link compensation to outcomes, and adopt resolutions at annual meetings has increased, and companies are looking for ways to manage them. Occidental Petroleum and Conoco recently asked the Securities and Exchange Commission if they could ignore these resolutions at their annual meetings since climate goals are now just a part of ordinary business operations, but the SEC denied the request and ordered them to proceed with the votes. These shareholder challenges are becoming more common not only with oil and gas majors, but across the energy and resource sectors as carbon emissions, water use, and transparency become higher profile issues. 37 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition However, if we think about the relationship between ESG investors and the ENR sector as progressing in waves, it may be time to declare that this first, adversarial wave has run its course. The adversarial wave has achieved a great deal. Executives have a better understanding of the scale and urgency of the challenge before us, and most have committed to greater sustainability in their operations and products. Pilot programs are well underway, but to achieve scale industrialization of these transitions, we’ll need to take a different tack. Both sides, companies and investors, must begin to realize that they’re more likely to achieve their objectives through collaboration rather than confrontation. If companies want to ensure access to the capital necessary to build a net-zero world, they must be prepared to show they can scale quickly and demonstrate the economic viability of new models. For their part, investors should be prepared to “lean in” to companies that show they can reduce carbon emissions at scale and create new options for the future. First wave: confrontation In the wake of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, ESG investors sharpened their focus on corporate and investor responsibility, adopting one or more of these strategies. • Activism. Investors are pressing companies to raise their game on ESG matters through specific targets, measures, and portfolio shifts, and to adopt specific resolutions, such as linking executive compensation to outcomes. • Avoidance. Investment funds are announcing policy guidelines and have divested from companies that failed to meet their expectations. • Articulation. Investors are requiring companies to redouble their efforts and shift communications from low-impact vanity projects to fully formed strategic plans and roadmaps, with economic rationales. Leading companies are beginning to make progress, setting CO2 targets in line with the Paris Agreement and addressing relevant aspects of United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Others are improving the transparency of their supply chains and appointing new faces to boards to speak more forcefully for sustainability. Companies are tackling larger issues collaboratively, as in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. While a lot of work lies ahead, the contours are beginning to emerge of a next wave that will require more cooperation. Second wave: collaboration With momentum established and ESG targets growing, the challenge shifts from recognizing the need to change, to funding that change sufficiently to make a difference. Energy and resource companies will need to draw on the strength of their traditional businesses to secure funding for capital expenditure in new assets and infrastructure that supports the energy transition, everything from 38 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition bio feedstock production to renewable power generation, hydrogen electrolyzers, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, waste recycling, and much more. However, over the past decade, investors have been more attracted to other sectors, particularly technology and communications. In 2010, companies in energy, utilities, materials, and the industrial sector made up 30% of the S&P 500; by the end of 2020, their share had fallen to 16%. The top five oil and gas supermajors together have lost about $200 billion in market capitalization since 2015, compromising their ability to fund change at the scale and pace required. Some will be able to recapture that ability by investing in promising second engines of growth in more sustainable businesses, such as the announcements by several oil and gas leaders of investments in areas like low-carbon power and carbon capture and storage. These commitments can spark a virtuous cycle that enables investors to rerate valuation multiples for longer-dated sustainable assets and put shareholder returns and market values back on an upward path. Improving the balance sheet this way ensures access to capital and the ability to reinvest in greater sustainability. ESG investors could achieve more by investing in areas that need capital, instead of pulling back. ESG investors can support this momentum by turning from adversary to advocate, leaning in to companies that demonstrate a good change trajectory—those showing 20% to 30% of future revenues coming from new, sustainable activities. They could achieve more by investing in areas that need capital, instead of pulling back. A poorly funded energy producer with a weak balance sheet is less capable of reducing or offsetting its carbon footprint than a well-supported, well-funded one. In some cases, ESG investors could go further by helping public companies go fully or partially private for a spell, to speed up transitions that could be much more difficult under public ownership. Dell’s 2013 deal with Silver Lake to take the company private again after 24 years on public markets allowed Dell to rapidly reorient its business. Dell went public again in 2018 and now has a market cap that tops $75 billion—a testament to the success of its bold move. Other companies will transform themselves or spin off some of their more sustainable businesses to try to revalue their market positions and ensure better access to capital. Few have gone as far as Ørsted, which reoriented its business model from fossil fuels to wind energy in only a few years and has been rewarded with a return to profitability and a price-to-earnings ratio that reached as high as 40 in 2021. But many others are doing something similar with parts of the company. The spin-off of Siemens Energy in May 2020 combined some of the parent company’s renewable and hydrogen assets into a new firm that investors could revalue based on the long-term potential of these more 39 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition sustainable business models. ENI has also said that it’s considering spinning off or selling a minority stake in its retail and renewable businesses in 2022, to allow those parts of its business to be revalued based on their fast growth. Third wave: reinforcement Where might we be in five years? If energy and natural resources companies and their investors are where they say they’d like to be in 2026, what will have changed to make that progress possible? First, the relationship between these companies and their investors will have improved. Looking back from 2026, we saw a sea change in the dialogue between them, which became more constructive and cooperative. The best energy and resource companies were no longer just trying to convince shareholders and customers that they were doing the right things; they began demonstrating that they were changing their operations, adapting their products, and getting positive results in revenues and capex profiles. As their operations changed, they became more transparent, and the twoway dialogue became more innovative, reinforcing, and forward-looking. Their relationship with customers also changed, with ENR companies seen as key partners for business and responsible suppliers for consumers. At the same time, these companies moved beyond pilot programs and began revamping their operations and supply chains at an industrial scale. They learned quickly and applied that learning rapidly in the next generation of activity. As these new businesses and methodologies matured, executives realized that they really can redefine the economics of their industries. They were no longer investing below the desired rate of return and hoping for a subsidy; they were investing at the rate and seeing attractive returns. Executives got better at measuring the things that traditional metrics like net present value overlook, things like company reputation, competitive advantage, customer advocacy, and the expansive options created by a growing, sustainable business. As the energy and natural resources sectors got better at reducing and mitigating emissions, other aspects of the ESG agenda also moved closer to center stage: water scarcity, diversity and equity issues, corporate governance, stronger relationships with local communities. Some executives looked back nostalgically at a time when their performance was measured simply by profitability and share price. Those, of course, remain essential, but by 2026, the other elements of the ESG scorecard were also important indicators of a company’s resilience and success. 40 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition If ESG investors and energy and resource companies can decide to work together to pursue their common goals, there’s every reason to believe they can achieve them. Whether this hindsight view becomes a reality depends entirely on how we engage in constructive dialogue across the chasm that now exists. The ambitious goals of 2030 and 2050 remain critical, and our position in 2026 will show whether we’re on the right trajectory. ESG investors and the leaders of energy and resource companies can decide to work together to pursue their common goals, and given their long record of success, there’s every reason to believe they can achieve them. The alternative would be the escalation of a dysfunctional relationship between the organizations most capable of making the energy transition a reality and the financing mechanisms that should be deployed to make that possible. 41 While the market for blue and green hydrogen takes shape, some companies are already climbing the experience curve. By Aaron Denman, Søren Konnerup, Peter Meijer, and Brian Murphy Business Opportunities in Low-Carbon Hydrogen Critical Trends of the Energy and Natural Resources Transition At a Glance The supply of blue and green hydrogen is still small, but energy, natural resources, and industrial companies are beginning to explore how customers will use hydrogen. Economic feasibility will vary greatly depending on the availability of low-carbon alternatives, which will affect whether regions export or import blue and green hydrogen. Consortia of companies are forming around the opportunity to climb the experience curve and gain early-mover advantages. 42 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition As climate change has risen to the top of the agenda for governments, investors, and companies, it’s becoming clear that traditional abatement strategies won’t get us to the goal of net-zero emissions, even with better energy efficiency and the introduction of vast amounts of renewable energy, biofuels, batteries, and carbon capture. Other innovations will be needed, and among the most promising is low-carbon hydrogen, which will help close the gap in industries that could prove hard to abate otherwise, including heavy-duty transportation, steel manufacturing, and production of fertilizer and methanol. The current market for hydrogen is about 115 million metric tons, but Bain’s research estimates this could increase to 300 million metric tons by 2050, with the low-carbon component growing from virtually nonexistent to most of the supply. (For more on the developing market for hydrogen, read the Bain Brief “Five Imperatives to Thrive in a Hydrogen Future.”) Growth rates in green hydrogen (produced from zero-carbon sources) and blue hydrogen (produced from low-carbon sources) will outpace traditional energy markets, creating attractive opportunities along the value chain. Hydrogen’s feasibility will vary across regions and industries, and many companies are already experimenting in consortia to expand hydrogen’s reach. Most are grappling with the same questions. What’s the best way to participate in the burgeoning hydrogen market? What are the most attractive opportunities, where should we play in the value chain, and how do we ensure we have the right capabilities to move forward? Identifying opportunities Much of the attention has focused on how to supply low-carbon hydrogen at prices competitive with gray hydrogen (made from fossil fuels) or other low-carbon energy sources, but customer demand will ultimately drive the market. Leaders start by developing a clear understanding of their customer’s needs, then figure out where hydrogen could make sense in filling them. This requires determining whether the cost of hydrogen can be competitive, given regional dynamics, regulatory incentives, and other low-carbon alternatives. Even when it cannot, some customers may be willing to pay more to meet their own sustainability goals. Early projects show several different approaches, including some that are already feasible without subsidies, and others intended to develop new markets (see Figure 1). 43 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition For most applications, low-carbon hydrogen isn’t yet competitive with other low-carbon technologies, but there are a few exceptions, depending on location and other factors. Forklifts are one example. Because the refueling time is much faster than for a battery, and because a fuel cell’s output doesn’t wane at low-charge levels, forklifts powered with hydrogen fuel cells already present a competitive option with superior performance and flexibility. An electrolyzer running from grid-sourced renewable electricity can produce enough green hydrogen for a fleet of forklifts. Vehicles used in mining are another example where hydrogen could make sense as a tool for decarbonizing, given the similar uptime requirements. Other applications make economic sense only in certain places with unique economics. To identify these opportunities, companies need to determine regional differences in the economics of hydrogen—in other words, they must “de-average” global costs. For example, at a global average, green hydrogen is about two to three times as expensive as gray hydrogen. But much of that cost difference lies between the renewable electricity used to generate green and the price of natural gas to produce gray, whose prices vary widely by region. Places endowed with rich renewable energy conditions (such as plenty of wind and sunshine) can offer far better economics for green hydrogen. In Chile, for example, few hydrogen projects are underway, but ample wind and solar could help it produce low-carbon hydrogen for less than $2 per kilogram by 2025. Understanding where below-average low-carbon hydrogen costs align with above-average alternative costs will lead to the earliest pairings of supply and demand. Market exists today for specific applications Market exists today, typically with subsidies ESG motivation first, competitive later Breaking ground, new market to develop Examples Where to look Toyota forklifts Hydrogen fuel cells recharge faster than batteries, and perform better at low-charge levels Applications where hydrogen performs well and the need to decarbonize is strong (such as avoiding indoor emissions) Geographic pockets with favorable economics (California, Arizona, the European Union) Regions with oil, ammonia, or methanol production and aggressive net-zero ambitions (Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium) Regions with access to cheap renewable energy but with less demand for hydrogen (Chile, Australia, the Middle East) Nikola Motor Company Hydrogen refueling stations for fuel cell trucks to transport beer for AB InBev H2 Green Steel Iron and steel production using renewable energy to produce hydrogen North-C-Methanol Integrated methanol offtake from green H2 and captured CO2 in industrial cluster Ofgem and SGN Home heating in Scotland, with significant investment from regulator and government thyssenkrupp 88MW hydro-to-H2 plant in Quebec; final offtake will require market development Air Products, Neom, ACWA 4GW solar/wind-toammonia in Neom, but final market still unclear Note: ESG stands for environmental, social, and corporate governance Source: Company websites and press releases Figure 1: Hydrogen projects show a range of models; some are based on market economics and others depend on subsidies 44 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition In regions with excess renewable energy, hydrogen offers a lowcost way to use electricity that might otherwise be curtailed. In regions with excess renewable energy, hydrogen offers a low-cost way to use electricity that might otherwise be curtailed. For example, in the sunny southwestern US, zero-emission truck maker Nikola Motor Company secured a below-market rate for solar-generated electricity ($27 per megawatt hour) to produce more competitive hydrogen, some of which will refuel trucks for AnheuserBusch’s shipping lane from Arizona to California. This agreement highlights how hydrogen can help companies meet their decarbonization commitments. Smelting is another example of an application with long-term potential for hydrogen, but where unique economics and government subsidies enable early applications. ArcelorMittal, for example, has announced plans to retrofit two of its plants in Germany to make carbon-neutral (or green) steel. In Sweden, the steel manufacturer H2 Green Steel provides yet another example. In this case, an abundance of renewable energy and iron ore makes green hydrogen an attractive route to produce low-carbon steel. The pipeline for announced hydrogen projects grows nearly every day. Many of these involve consortia of companies teaming up to meet demands along the value chain, from development of facilities through production of hydrogen and consumption in the making of ammonia or methanol (see Figure 2). Although low-carbon hydrogen still costs more than gray hydrogen, these industrial companies are gaining experience that their competitors lack. At the North-C-Methanol project in Belgium, for example, hydrogen produced with renewable energy is consumed in methanol production along with captured CO2 , greening the process. Japan’s power sector represents another set of hydrogen customers with environmental, social and corporate governance commitments, high alternative fuel costs, and limited options to decarbonize. Projects are also underway in regions with lots of wind and solar energy but limited domestic consumption of hydrogen. Neom, an experimental city of the future under development in northwestern Saudi Arabia, is one such location. A $5 billion collaboration between Neom, Air Products & Chemicals, and Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power will produce green hydrogen with electricity generated by solar in the day and wind at night, to gain experience, develop the market, and scale production as demand rises to meet it. In the near term, this systems approach will produce hydrogen for use locally in Neom, with the long-term goal of scaling to support exports. Australian production follows a similar model and is the global leader in announced green hydrogen projects (see Figure 3). 45 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Sources: International Energy Agency Hydrogen Projects Database; news articles; Bain & Company analysis Supply leaders with long-term export potential Demand leaders with aggressive decarbonization Australia 28.9 Wind and solar Netherlands 13.3 Offshore wind Belgium 7.0 Offshore wind Denmark 3.7 Offshore wind Saudia Arabia 4.0 Wind and solar Electrolyzer capacity (GW) and main sources for announced projects United Kingdom 4.2 Offshore wind China 5.2 Wind and solar Figure 3: The seven countries with the greatest green hydrogen capacity vary in their likely longterm roles Renewable power Manufacturer (including R&D and system integration) Plant operations and production Applications Phillips 66 Production located next to user Ørsted Element Energy ITM Power Gigastack Shell Element Energy ITM Power Refhyne Shell Shell and others NortH2 Groningen Seaports, Gasunie unspecified unspecified Shell, RWE, Equinor Engineering, procurement, and construction Transport and storage Gigastack in UK Refhyne in Germany NortH2 in Netherlands Sources: Market participant interviews; news articles; company websites; Bain & Company analysis Figure 2: Companies are collaborating in consortia across the value chain 46 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Utilities Oil and gas Industrial gas Renewable energy original equipment manufacturers Electrolyzers Offtakers (Refining, fertilizers, chemicals, aluminium, steel) • Natural extension of business in building and owning assets • Strong capabilities in renewable energy development, as well as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) • Existing relationships across the value chain, including offtakers (refiners, chemicals, fertilizers, aluminium, steel) • Potential green hydrogen customers • Gas capabilities and emerging renewable energy capabilities make hydrogen a logical choice for a second growth engine • Substantial development experience • Core competencies in production and handling of industrial gases • Familiarity with customers in long-term industrial demand segments • Experience with renewable energy generation, hydrogen production, and system integration with electrolyzer • Existing global scale, footprint and relationships in EPC, as well as service • Identification of high-potential green energy production locations • Key technical enabler for green hydrogen • Supply shortage expected in the short to medium term could provide leverage • Ability to drive early demand for existing production facilities • Some familiarity with gray production should help transition to blue • Industry knowledge needed to integrate hydrogen into existing production Note: Select examples, not exhaustive Source: Bain & Company Figure 4: Different sectors have varied advantages in building an edge in the hydrogen economy Finding your place in the value chain The market for low-carbon hydrogen is new and likely to remain in flux for a while. As players consolidate their views and experiment with business models, many are struggling to get started and find their focus. The most effective way to avoid dead-end experiments and to gain a leading position is to develop a clear view of the value chain, potential profit pools, and what it takes to win in these future profit pools. As in any new market, companies should assess which current capabilities might give them a competitive edge in hydrogen (see Figure 4). A European manufacturer in the renewable energy space considered its strengths in engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC); electrical systems; power controls; and system integration. Geographically, it has a strong presence in several locations with potentially high demand. Executives decided that it could use these capabilities to design powergenerating assets and production sites for low-cost hydrogen and help scale production in the electrolysis industry. 47 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Closing capability gaps In the emerging hydrogen project consortia, companies are combining their strengths to complete the value chain. In many cases, oil and gas majors or utilities are taking on the role of project developer, with the output often used within refining, ammonia production, or blending into existing natural gas networks. Securing such offtake partnerships is critical for these early consortia, because a significant merchant market isn’t expected to develop before 2030. In the current project pipeline, some oil and gas companies are taking both the project developer and offtake roles. Over time, the value chain is likely to consolidate as companies integrate forward or backward. For example, manufacturing and EPC companies in oil and gas or renewable energy could extend their core capabilities into optimizing electrolyzer production, taking out weight, applying a modular approach, and procuring components at lower cost. At the same time, these companies may need to close gaps in stack and electrolysis design, where there are many partnerships with electrolysis pure players. New partnerships will be essential. Consider a renewable energy original equipment manufacturer (OEM) seeking a larger role in the value chain, which might include electrolysis design and access to end customers. It would make sense to seek out an electrolysis partner to combine capabilities to design and scale production. To cover its gaps in the gas and end-consumer markets, it could partner with strong midstream and downstream partners, such as oil and gas majors. That would help the OEM focus on taking market share and developing repeatable models that will enable it to expand to other geographies. Moving forward to execute The hydrogen market is moving quickly. A year ago, most executives were just beginning to consider where hydrogen would play a role in their industry’s value chain. Today, companies have started deploying strategies for using hydrogen, all while maintaining the flexibility to adjust as the market evolves and conditions change. Winners in this market will be companies that can develop a keen understanding of hydrogen’s potential and economic feasibility, as well as a determination of their place on the value chain. Setting long-term strategic goals will be essential, with progress measured against short-term milestones. Finally, no new program will gain much traction without strong support from senior management. Some companies will invest in hydrogen as a second engine of growth (see “Engine 2: How to Grow a Sustainable New Business”). Only by guaranteeing continued support, and securing the resources to make it happen, can companies ensure that their investments in hydrogen will have a chance to succeed in the developing energy economy.

By Alistair Corbett, Emily Emmett, Felipe Gattass, and Brian Murphy Strategic Advantages for Addressing the Transition Raising Productivity in Energy and Natural Resources Capital Projects At a Glance Large construction projects frequently run over budget and beyond schedule. That’s got to change. To pay for the energy transition, companies need to spend capital more efficiently. Deploying cross-functional teams and Agile methodologies in the engineering phase of projects can save time and money. More transparent procurement processes, with cost benchmarks, can increase the efficiency of money going to suppliers. Better cooperation between construction contractors and managers can improve efficiency in construction; one mining company recovered 12 months of lost time and saved over $500 million on a major project. 51 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Utilities 36% Energy 21 Mining 13 Materials 8 S&P 500 7 Other industries 5 Capital spending as a percentage of revenue for S&P 500 companies (fiscal 2019) Sources: S&P Capital IQ; Bain & Company Figure 1: Energy and natural resources industries spend a greater share of revenues on capex than other industries No sector spends more of its revenues on capital expenses than the companies in energy and natural resources (see Figure 1). They’ll have to spend much more as they retrofit old assets and build new ones that meet increasingly strict sustainability requirements, those imposed on them by regulators and the goals they set themselves. Estimated spending on infrastructure to meet the needs of a decarbonizing economy range as high as $50 trillion over the next three decades. Some of these capital projects represent new opportunities where incumbents lack experience—for example, in hydrogen, renewables, carbon capture and storage, and rare earth materials. These will carry new risks, and that will make it even more challenging for these companies to properly allocate capital to these investments. No sector spends more of its revenues on capital expenses than the companies in energy and natural resources. 52 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition But capital projects across the sector are already notorious for delays and cost overruns (see Figure 2). Bain’s analysis of 76 large energy and natural resources projects around the world found that 34% of them incurred cost overruns, which averaged about 17%, and 84% faced delays, which averaged more than two years. Those that do finish on time often have budgets that allow for low productivity and high costs. Many of these are megaprojects in oil and gas, utilities, chemicals, and mining, netting out in the billions and tens of billions of dollars. The vast scale of these projects, their complexity, and the long timelines all contribute to the many delays and overruns. As the development requirements become more stringent to meet environmental and community demands, these projects will become even more expensive and complex. For example, some mines are using ocean water so that their operations don’t drain the fresh groundwater supply. But using ocean water—transporting and desalinating it—can add 15% to 30% to a multibillion-dollar mining project. Implementing carboncapture or emissions-reduction technologies on industrial plants also increase the costs. These companies really need to develop and build new capital projects more efficiently if they want to remain leaders. Oil and gas companies, utilities, and chemicals and mining firms will compete for capital and other resources as they seek out first-mover advantages, trying to position themselves higher on the learning curve than competitors that take a wait-and-see attitude. Slow movers may find themselves saddled with stranded assets and businesses in decline if they can’t adapt to new demands. Given all that’s at stake, capital efficiency advantages of even 10% to 20% or shorter schedules to get projects to market could have existential implications. Of 76 major projects in operation from 2015 to 2019 ... encountered delays went over budget 84% 34% Note: Includes projects developed by large public and private engineering and procurement firms, large oil-refining companies, and large natural gas and oilfield equipment companies Sources: IHS Markit; Bain analysis Figure 2: Many energy projects encounter delays and go over budget, leaving significant money on the table 53 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition To try to capture those gains, companies are redesigning their models for engineering, procurement, and construction. One of the most important steps is adopting an Agile methodology with a lean mindset shared by the project team, the engineering contractor, the sponsor, and the client. In procurement, better analysis of costs and greater transparency are helping to rein in costs. And in construction, closer cooperation among the construction contractors and construction managers, coupled with a “red is good” mentality—that is, a willingness to deal with problems rather than ignore them—can improve capital efficiency. Companies that are executing well on these three dimensions are reducing capex by 15% to 30% and shortening construction schedules by 6 to 18 months. More Agile engineering For a long time, the engineering phase of capital projects has been trapped in a single way of working that results in long development times and frequent rework. Firms usually outsource the design task to the engineering firm with the lowest bid and limit their own involvement to reviews at key stages. This waterfall method works well for slow-moving, simple projects. But it falls short against the demands of frequently changing projects in a competitive environment. Some energy and resource companies are beginning to deploy Agile methodologies to shorten the engineering cycle and expand the owner’s role from a reviewer to a more active participant. Agile speeds up the cycle by bringing cross-functional teams together, with experts from the areas that should have a voice in the design, including construction, sustainability, planning, and control. One global mining company experimenting with Agile found that it helped cut the basic engineering cycle of a project in half while reducing staff hours by 40%. The active involvement from other related functions resulted in a simpler and more capital-efficient design. Scaling the methodology across the entire engineering team will require a big transformation, with changes to the operating model and procurement processes. Another company used Agile teams to improve the design of a conveyor belt system for carrying materials out of a mine, cutting 15% off the cost. Among the innovations that a cross-functional team contributed: instead of lining the belt’s corridor with a series of individual lamps, each requiring its own wiring and maintenance, the design used two rows of LED lighting tape, which was quicker to install, less expensive to maintain, and distributed light more evenly throughout the corridor. Others are using Agile in early stages like concept definition and contractor selection, shortening the time to evaluate trade-offs and learning how to determine the minimum amount of information necessary to make good decisions. Of course, in the mission-critical designs that make up most projects in the sector, Agile methodology can’t mean abandoning good governance. But companies experimenting with Agile are finding that it works well within the bounds of a traditional stage-gate process. 54 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition More transparent procurement Traditional procurement entails bidding on unit-cost or lump-sum contracts to get the best rate at the lowest risk. But these contracts carry a fair amount of uncertainty and risk, so construction companies usually build a cushion into their bids by padding the price of labor, materials, or other general costs, or by stretching the schedule. These risk-adjusted prices then become the baseline for the contract’s management, and both the contractor and the construction manager will direct the project according to these inefficient targets. Inevitably, unforeseen costs arise, and these get added on top of the already inefficient base. Organizations wind up running on contracts based on unknown risks, lax yields, and long schedules. A better way to manage procurement is to analyze contract costs based on benchmarks and reviews. A cross-functional team, with people from engineering, procurement, construction, and supply, should lead negotiations with contractors. Negotiations should be transparent and technical, structured in ways that ensure the contractors understand the scope and context of the project, and include open discussions on construction methodologies, yields, and staffing requirements. When owners also take on the risks that the contractor can’t manage—such as interference from other contractors or with operations—they can manage these conflicts better, reducing costs and making construction more efficient. Construction: Red is good Engineering and procurement both set the stage for the most difficult phase of any project, construction. While other sectors have significantly raised productivity over the past two decades, construction is an outlier (see Figure 3). One reason is that construction has been among the slowest sectors to embrace digital technologies—though that’s beginning to change. Building information modeling (BIM), advanced work packaging (AWP), and connected worker solutions are among the initiatives that construction companies and their customers are deploying to make their capital projects more efficient. But companies also need to find better ways to work with their contractors to boost productivity and shorten construction schedules. One way they can do this is through joint reviews of the construction schedule, examining the sequence, construction methodology, and productivity yields. They set the target by building a schedule based on ideal conditions, then work to meet those milestones. To make daily progress on this full-potential schedule, they follow daily routines, hold weekly obeya meetings (war room sessions to review progress, causes of noncompliance, and the next week’s plan), and employ other continuous improvement techniques borrowed from lean manufacturing. Contractors and construction managers meet weekly to discuss progress on the sequence and yields, and how to clear barriers that are hurting productivity. 55 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Of course, all this is easier said than done. Accomplishing it requires a shift in mindset among the leaders of the construction contractor and construction management teams, and their sponsorship must be reinforced and transparent to everyone on the team. Leaders adopt a “red is good” mentality: workers who flag something that is off track or falling short are praised rather than punished, because it allows the project leaders to identify problems and opportunities for improvement. One mining company that adopted these construction management techniques recovered about 12 months of lost time, saving more than $500 million and putting the project back on track to finish ahead of schedule. These dramatic increases in productivity and efficiency are the kinds of change that energy and natural resources companies should aspire to if they want to lead the transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon economy. The record is mixed, and this path requires openness to new ways of working and a collaborative mindset. But the opportunity is huge, and the path forward is clear and achievable.

By Peter Guarraia and Stephan Zech Creating Resilience, Sustainability, and Accountability in Supply Chains Strategic Advantages for Addressing the Transition At a Glance Supply chain goals are now about more than price, quality, and inventory levels. Shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic underscored the importance of building resilience into supply chains. As consumers and shareholders demand greater accountability and sustainability in their products, supply chains are also becoming more transparent and traceable. New digital tools are helping companies reduce waste, improve accountability, and increase worker safety. 57 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition For most of their careers, supply chain and operations managers have had a clear mandate: source materials and deliver products at the right levels of quality, for the best available price. In energy and natural resources, that has meant delivering crude oil, natural gas or refined products, chemicals and plastics, mined materials, and agricultural products, all at the right levels of quality and at prices customers will pay. Suddenly, that formula has become much more complicated. Quality and price remain table stakes. But operations are now measured on a broader scorecard, which can include greenhouse gas emissions and other measures of sustainability, resilience to supply and operations disruption, and accountability for the social impacts of their business. Consider the events of just the past year or so. In oil and gas, demand dropped suddenly in the spring of 2020, leaving producers with a glut so large that West Texas Intermediate crude dipped into negative pricing for a day. In agriculture, as lockdowns kept consumers at home, product demand shifted away from food prepared and packaged for out-of-home dining to a new emphasis on products consumed at home. Agricultural companies had to continue to supply the world’s markets while retooling packaging operations and coping with a workforce affected by the virus. These sudden shifts came at almost the same moment that customers, shareholders, and governments were demanding more accountability for carbon emissions, plastic production, and other externalities, not only in a company’s own operations, but for its upstream supply chains and downstream customers. Supply chain and operations teams must develop new capabilities—and quickly. All this means that the days of business as usual are over. Supply chain and operations teams must develop new capabilities—and quickly. Playing to a more balanced scorecard will require a lot of changes: reducing the carbon footprint, building greater resilience in the supply chain, creating more transparency, and ensuring accountability. The pandemic sped up this change, and by mid-2020, supply chain executives were already reprioritizing their investments. Bain’s survey of operations executives found that their investments would focus less on cost reduction and speed, and more on resilience and flexibility (see Figure 1). 58 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition New digital capabilities The good news is that by building up the new muscles necessary to thrive in a period of greater scrutiny and more intense competition, companies can turn their operations into a true competitive weapon. An operating model that can balance efficiency with sustainability, transparency, accountability, and resilience is a model that can differentiate a company in its marketplace. Legacy enterprise management tools, while still essential, cannot meet all the needs of a rapidly evolving operations unit. Increasingly, companies will need to adopt and develop the next generation of digital tools that focus on very specific problems, such as transparency and accountability in a supply chain, network optimization, and inventory optimization. Bain research finds that 85% of the companies surveyed said they’re investing in big data and analytics. These tools have already proven themselves: advanced analytics can improve supply chain forecast accuracy by up to 60%. The next wave of capability building needs to close the loop, ensuring that the insights gleaned from analytics are put to work in operations to generate value.

The first waves of industrial automation addressed large, repetitive tasks, usually in controlled, manufacturing environments. A new wave of smart automation employs artificial intelligence and Internet of Things systems to manage difficult, dangerous, or precise tasks more flexibly. The shift promises to enable much more automation in energy and natural resources industries, which are often in more open and variable environments. For example, one technique to efficiently mine potash has required a human observer to direct a boring machine at the most promising veins of salts among dirt and rock, deep underground. Smart automation puts sensors and intelligence on the process, making the same or better decisions about where to aim the borer—improving yields, reducing waste, and keeping the operator in a safer location. Drone monitoring is also promising. For example, utilities that rely on coal fuel can deploy drones to survey their stock of coal, make 3-D models, calculate the remaining supply, and report on the condition (dry or wet) of the coal. • End-to-end visibility. Companies are integrating their data sets, because that gives them a more comprehensive view of inventory levels and availability across the supply chain. But today, transparency is about more than just inventory. It helps companies see where products and components come from, and that helps them live up to their environmental and social commitments. Olam International, a commodity food company based in Singapore, developed the digital platform AtSource that traces food back through the supply chain, across processors, suppliers, and farmers. The platform provides a digital dashboard that also provides copious economic and contextual information gathered from the field, including premiums paid to farmers, emissions, land and water use, and social conditions of worker families. • Intelligent supply chain. Bain research found that more than half of executives in the energy and natural resources sector surveyed said they weren’t satisfied with the accuracy of their demand forecasting (see Figure 2). Advanced forecasting and more sophisticated demand models promote accurate planning, which can reduce waste, not only improving the return on investment, but also reducing the footprint of supply chain operations. In the Permian Basin, for example, one oilfield service company employs remote monitoring and algorithmic forecasting to know when a well needs more drilling fluid. This reduces waste by eliminating the need for the company or its customers to send out trucks on broad “milk runs” to check on drilling fluid. 60 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Predictive planning can go much further, aggregating all the relevant data from a range of sources, including inventory levels and consumption levels, constraints in the production process, and external factors that can affect demand—everything from business cycles to the weather. Intelligent systems can generate future scenarios based on observed patterns and real-time data and come up with probability scenarios and their effects on the supply chain. • Next-generation talent. As in other industries, frontline workers in energy and natural resources are becoming more technically savvy, by necessity. As the systems they depend on become more sophisticated, workers are being retrained to understand and work with the digital systems that increasingly monitor and guide their activities. Technology is also supporting workers in their tasks and increasing their safety. Assisted-reality (AR) headsets are moving from experimental stages to scale deployment, putting visual guidance for an unlimited range of tasks literally at workers’ fingertips. One North American maritime contractor that was having difficulty finding enough skilled welders developed a system that combined artificial intelligence with AR, projecting instructions on a head-mounted display that guided welders through each task.

(For a detailed look at capital investments, see “Raising Productivity in Energy and Natural Resources Capital Projects.”) If a company’s capital investment decisions are still based only on reducing costs, its investment thesis is failing to keep up with its strategic ambitions. 62 xx Section title As pressure builds on energy and natural resources companies to change their businesses, they can tap their existing assets and skills to develop new ones. By Sasha Duchnowski, Aleksander Lyngvi, and Brian Murphy Strategic Advantages for Addressing the Transition Engine 2: How to Grow a Sustainable New Business At a Glance The energy transition and the shift to a low-carbon economy are disrupting industries, but also creating new opportunities. Energy and natural resources companies must develop a second engine of growth, an “Engine 2” that combines the assets of the core business with entrepreneurial energy. Engine 2 also signals to investors and new talent that the company is looking forward and developing new businesses that can thrive through the energy transition. Successful Engine 2s focus on the customer’s evolving needs and adopt an insurgent mentality, which allows them to compete against new competition. 63 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Figure 1: Most executives say the energy and resource transition will change their company’s core business 0 20 40 60 80 100% All sectors Oil and gas Agribusiness Chemicals Utilities Mining and minerals New energy Services and financial markets Percentage of executives who say the transitions will affect their business to this extent, by sector Fundamentally To some extent Not at all Source: Bain ENR Transition Survey, October 2020 (n=69) Executives in some energy and natural resources (ENR) companies are looking out 5 or 10 years and wondering: Will my core business still be viable? It’s a reasonable question when the dynamics of sustainability and technology—low-carbon energy, electrification, and circular economics, for example—are disrupting industries that have been running on the same business model for years (see Figure 1). At the same time, they’re also creating new opportunities in related businesses, and this is where many of those executives already realize they need to focus. The technical, operational, and management capabilities that serve these companies well today are going to help them move into adjacent businesses like carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen, electrification and batteries, new minerals, energy as a service, sustainable packaging, and high-margin sustainable food. We call this Engine 2, the development of a second source of growth within the company that draws on the assets and capabilities of the core business, applying them in new ways. A successful Engine 2 taps the entrepreneurial energy of a start-up while taking advantage of the full benefits of scale of the entire organization. 64 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition In the energy and natural resources sector, two forces are coming together to create new growth opportunities: the demand for sustainability, and the new technologies that are making more sustainable businesses possible. While many of these technologies like solar and wind have been around for a while, they’ve only recently reached levels of maturity that make them cost effective and competitive with older technology. That’s opening the door for businesses that are as focused on the bottom line as on their sustainability goals. In today’s environment of intense scrutiny, the benefits of an Engine 2 that emphasizes sustainability go beyond revenue generation. Engine 2 ventures can be an important signal to investors that leadership is keenly aware of pressures on the existing business and has its eye on the profit pools of the future. Although the initial revenues from Engine 2 will be small, they can boost confidence in the company’s future, making investment more attractive. Engine 2 efforts are also vital in attracting top talent, particularly in industries that are often considered slow to move or resistant to new technology. What to look for in an Engine 2 How should companies decide where to place bets that allow them to stand out from the crowd? Bain’s research has identified four factors common to successful Engine 2s. • Rapidly growing profit pools, fueled by big trends. These future-fit profit pools include zero-carbon energy, carbon markets, green steel, sustainable fuels, high-margin sustainable food products, specialty chemicals, and commodities for batteries, like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. • New levers of competitive advantage, often because technology has blurred business boundaries. In energy, for example, upstream companies are starting to compete with renewable energy pure-plays, traditional utilities, storage providers, carbon offset providers, and start-ups. • Capabilities or skills from Engine 1 that power Engine 2. These could be resource access, project development or integration skills, technology, customers, partners, or access to capital, which all can provide advantages to Engine 2. • An entrepreneurial spirit inside the company. This may not come naturally to incumbents that have grown by developing resources with capex-intense, large assets. But it’s essential to nurture because one of the main reasons for Engine 2 failures is that incumbents underestimate the competitors that are already in the market. Remember, your Engine 2 is someone else’s Engine 1. Across energy and natural resources sectors, the same underlying triggers (sustainability and technology) are feeding these conditions for Engine 2 growth. As a result, many players within each industry are looking at the same list of Engine 2 themes (see Figure 2). 65 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Figure 2: Energy and natural resources companies are pursuing a common set of Engine 2 opportunities Chemicals Energy Mining Agriculture Green products Circularity Storage Renewables, power-to-X Green steel, green cement, and other materials incorporating green hydrogen Traceability and sourcing services Alternative protein Circularity Transition commodities (lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earth minerals) Hydrogen Biofuels and other low-carbon fuels Offsets, carbon markets, and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) Services (energy as a service, decarbonization, operations, digital) Commercialization of new technologies, developed in-house Notes: Power-to-X refers to uses for the excess electricity from renewable sources that might otherwise have to be curtailed; green hydrogen is made with electricity from low-carbon, renewable sources; circularity includes designing products and packaging to reduce waste and promote recycling and more efficient reuse of resources Source: Bain & Company But if most players are looking at similar options, how do you avoid your Engine 2 becoming just another Engine 2? The real secret sauce for Engine 2 success is the “how.” How to do Engine 2 Treat the customer as the battleground. Many energy and resources businesses will have treated the resource, the cost curve, the asset, the underground reservoir, or the infrastructure as the Engine 1 battleground. Even for commodity business, the battleground in Engine 2 is much more the customer. Customers’ businesses are changing, and that creates the Engine 2 opportunities to frame new solutions based on needs that customers may not yet have fully articulated. Engine 2s will demand more attention across the full R&D, product development, sales, marketing and customer service life cycle. For example, a specialty chemicals company worked closely with a select group of customers to understand the full potential of a new biodegradable polymer in specialist packaging applications. It chose the customers not only for their willingness to explore the potential of the new material, but also because they were likely to become vocal advocates for the new material once they understood its value. 66 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Invest as if building a new business. The business case needs to be strong to invest in Engine 2, but no one should expect the economics to pay off like Engine 1—at least not at first. Not unlike venture capital, investment needs to meet the long-term goals of the company rather than the shortterm needs of an investor market. New endeavors are less likely to be a single big investment, like a billion-dollar plant or new product development. They’re more likely to involve smaller and sequenced investments, triggered by testing and learning with customers—just like in a start-up. Because many Engine 2 opportunities are new businesses, it’s not certain how the profit pools will develop, so companies need to keep their options open. In fact, because Engine 2 options often involve unfamiliar experience curves (green hydrogen operates, for example, on different experience curves to traditional energy experience curves), speed of investment really matters to secure early-mover advantage with customers. It will take time to move down the experience curves, connect demand and supply, and develop the markets. As with any new business, making the best use of partnerships for customers, capabilities, and capital is key. Sometimes the right first move isn’t as the owner but as a minority interest in something with existing momentum. Hedging this way can also be an important signal of continuity to investors who remain committed to Engine 1 revenues and business models. Adopt an insurgent growth model. Managing an Engine 2 within a large business requires a nuanced balance to take advantage of the parent’s capability, while moving with the speed and energy of an insurgent. The growth model is closer to building a new venture than expanding the core business, with a fair amount of test-and-learn on the go. In this type of pursuit, it’s usually better to get started on something than to wait for the perfect plan. After all, your competitors are already on the move. ENR companies, particularly those with an engineering heritage, may struggle with this. They built their success on engineering projects to perfection, including capex and risk-heavy assets that fueled growth for decades. That model won’t work as well in an environment where they’re competing against start-ups, and outcomes are less certain. But every organization has people who can make this leap, bringing some of the mature organization’s DNA into the fray for the next-generation marketplace. The energy transition and the shift to a lower-carbon economy present natural opportunities for Engine 2s among today’s ENR incumbents—and the field is likely to crowd around the most promising contenders. Moving assertively and treating Engine 2 like a new venture rather than simply a new product or technology will help leaders launch new growth opportunities best suited to their capabilities and market position. Approaching the opportunity with a customer orientation and an insurgent mindset will be key to gaining and maintaining a competitive edge in Engine 2. 67 xx Section title Most large companies are announcing ambitious decarbonization goals. Setting a realistic path makes them more credible. By Martha Eggenberger and Nitesh Prakash Strategic Advantages for Addressing the Transition Accelerating the Journey to Net Zero At a Glance Many companies have set ambitious decarbonization goals in recent months, responding to pressure from activist investors and consumers. Delivering on those ambitions won’t be easy. Bain research finds that nearly half of all sustainability initiatives fail to reach their goals. Leaders set a clear ambition, develop a bankable plan, and embed the goals of carbon reduction in the company. They also recognize they’re part of a broad ecosystem and work with others to achieve common goals. 68 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Climate change was racing up the corporate agenda before Covid-19. Some thought the pandemic would delay action on the climate, given its longer horizon. But in 2021, climate action looks more urgent than ever. Nearly every large company has announced bold decarbonization ambitions, many that include not only the emissions from their own operations, but also those along the supply chain and through the end use of their products. Boards and management are under pressure from activist investors and highly engaged consumers to pursue those goals. Energy and natural resources companies are also feeling the pressure from insurgents that threaten to take market share with more sustainable products, whether that’s renewable electricity, alternatives to animal protein, or fuels that emit less carbon. Delivering on these ambitions is proving difficult, particularly for energy and natural resources companies when compared with other industries (see Figure 1). Bain research finds that across industries, sustainability programs have a higher chance of failure (47%) than the 20% failure rate for all change efforts. As with other change programs, companies need to build new capabilities, learn how to measure things in new ways, and hire fresh talent. Figure 1: Oil and gas, mining, and energy utility companies trail other industries in their climate commitments Consumer products Oil and gas Mining Construction building and real estate Utilities and energy-related 0 50 100 150 Number of companies taking science-based climate action 2015 16 17 18 19 20 Note: Companies that have either committed to or set targets with the Science-Based Targets initiative Sources: Science-Based Targets Initiative; annual reports; company sustainability reports 69 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Even so, decarbonization stands apart from other change programs, in several ways: • It takes a long time, often decades instead of years or months. • People outside the company (such as regulators and investors) can have as much effect on priorities as leaders within a company. • New technologies and other disruptions can force a shift in strategy, and long-term investment requires a leap of faith in the future. On the upside, there’s ample opportunity for companies that learn how to move quickly toward their climate goals, primarily because doing so inevitably involves expanding the portfolio to include new lines of low-carbon business. (For more, read the Bain Brief “When Less Carbon Means More Growth.”) New products, new markets, and new ways of working are all part of the path to net zero—changes that can make a company more attractive to investors and customers, who are measuring corporate performance in broader ways. Half of all energy and natural resources companies have put the energy transition at the center of their strategy, and 41% say they’re shifting priorities to take advantage of new opportunities. About 40% say they’re already implementing changes (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Half of executives are making the energy transition central to their strategy, and about 40% are already implementing change 0 20 40 60 80 100% Percentage of energy and natural resources executives who say the transition is a high priority…. …and what their companies are doing Starting to change priorities and create opportunities Central to the company’s future Not a significant feature Developing plans and ideas to accelerate the transition Actively implementing change “All in” and fully committed Focus remains on delivering and expanding the traditional core Source: Bain ENR Transition Survey, October 2020 (n=69) 70 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition The companies moving fastest on this path follow similar patterns: leadership aligns on the ambition, develops a bankable plan, and then works to embed decarbonization into the fabric of the organization. At the same time, they learn to see themselves as part of a broader ecosystem, reaching beyond their own organization, working with partners, suppliers, policymakers, and customers to help them in their journey. Set the ambition Customers and investors are urging companies to set more ambitious net-zero targets, which aim to reduce a company’s emissions as much as possible and mitigate the remainder by purchasing offsets that remove carbon from the atmosphere. But these targets need to be feasible, with a clear path to success. Most of these goals include not only Scope 1 and 2 emissions (from your own operations and from the energy used to conduct business), but also the Scope 3 emissions that are usually much more extensive, since they include upstream suppliers and the downstream use of products. Although many companies have announced net-zero ambitions 25 or 30 years into the future, it’s important to have a realistic path with verifiable signs of progress toward that goal, if the commitment is to be taken seriously. Develop a bankable plan Leaders develop a plan that includes strategic portfolio choices, operational improvements, and investments in offsets, such as forestry projects that preserve or increase natural carbon sinks. For example, many oil and gas companies are rebalancing their portfolios, shedding fossil-fuel assets and investing in renewable energy. Most can also find ways to reduce emissions in their operations. Even so, most won’t be able to reach net zero without purchasing offsets, so they’ll need to find ways to validate offsets and make sure they’re contributing their full measure to the net-zero equation. Companies prioritize these initiatives by assessing the potential for each and determining which ones are most feasible and fastest to implement. As technologies improve, regulations change, and the price of carbon rises, they’ll have to rebalance the elements of their plan and be willing to change emphasis as opportunities arise. Embed carbon reduction in the organization Even the most carefully crafted decarbonization plan won’t deliver results without an organization and operating model designed to move the needle. Embedding the plans in processes, budgets, and metrics can ensure continuing advancement. Decarbonization is likely to be on the agenda for 10 years or more, but it’s not likely to be the top item on the agenda. So companies need to balance decarbonization initiatives with other business priorities, removing obstacles that can thwart success. 71 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Engage with others To succeed in their net-zero ambitions, companies need to view themselves as part of a broad ecosystem that includes investors, suppliers, customers, competitors, regulators, and other stakeholders, including nongovernmental organizations and local communities. Even more than before, they need constructive conversations with different types of organizations, finding ways to create mutually beneficial solutions. Fortunately, climate change and decarbonization are proving to be topics that bring stakeholders together. Some of these collaborations may bring together many companies and policymakers, such as Denmark’s climate partnerships, which draw on the expertise of the private and public sectors to develop incentives and regulations for decarbonizing the country’s energy sector. (For more, read “Net Zero: From Political Goals to Industry Actions.”) Other examples will look more like technology development partnerships, like the collaboration between Anglo American mining and Umicore to research and develop technology that could make it easier to use hydrogen in fuel-cell electric vehicles. These and other examples show that to reach their net-zero goals, companies are raising their climate ambitions and developing strategic roadmaps that include portfolio rebalancing, more energyefficient operations, and investments in offsets. Some are reorganizing their leadership structure to ensure that accountability for reaching these goals runs from the senior ranks through the entire organization. Finally, recognizing that they can’t do it alone, companies are changing the way they work with partners, investors, and policymakers, since they share responsibility to develop constructive solutions that will move everyone closer to net zero. 72 xx Section title Digital technology is a key enabler for operations, commercial excellence, product development, and organizational and sustainability goals. By Joachim Breidenthal, Laurent Migom, and Natalie Naidoo Strategic Advantages for Addressing the Transition Four Ways to Scale Digital in Energy and Natural Resources Companies At a Glance Digital technologies are important enablers of change in energy and resource companies and are accelerating efforts to adapt to the energy and resource transition. Nearly every company has a successful pilot to share, but it’s proving harder to scale these experiments into full-scale digital transformations. Some of the reasons that initiatives flounder include an inability to focus on the most valuable projects, a lack of clarity on who’s accountable, and pilot programs that weren’t designed to scale. To scale digital initiatives successfully, companies focus on the cases that will deliver the most value, prepare to scale from the beginning, and put in place the right orchestration. 73 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Digital technologies, and the new ways of working that accompany them, are proving to be critical enablers for a broad spectrum of capabilities in companies across industries. Energy and natural resources companies are accelerating digital transformation efforts across a wide range of use cases, such as improving productivity in operations, elevating customer experience, pursuing new business models, or enhancing organizational performance. Digital technologies are also accelerating energy and resource companies’ efforts to reach their environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) goals. Digital can not only improve efficiency and free up funds for the energy transition, it can also have a direct impact on the environmental footprint, supply chain traceability, or governance transparency. One global chemicals group, for instance, used digital technology to create better transparency on its environmental performance, which has helped it reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. A European energy company deployed technology to automate GPS-guided bulldozers and trenchers to improve productivity and reduce costs for the construction of solar plants. And a global supplier of agricultural commodities successfully commercialized and scaled a sustainability platform that provided transparency on a range of ESG goals across the entire supply chain and for a range of food categories (see Figure 1). Figure 1: Digital technologies facilitate new capabilities across the company, including environmental, social, and governance principles Operations Customer ESG Product Organization Intelligent processes and assets Asset network optimization End-to-end supply chain planning and transparency Data-driven pricing and marketing Digital commerce and customer engagement Accelerated R&D and advanced modeling New digital business models Automation and self-service Data transparency and analytics Culture, talent, and digital ways of working Environmental impact (e.g., energy, emissions, waste) Traceable supply chains Social impact Transparency and governance Source: Bain & Company 74 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition Unfortunately, while nearly every company has a successful pilot story to share, very few have scaled up their digital experiments to the point of delivering significant value for the entire organization. Bain’s research finds that only 8% of companies say they’re getting their money’s worth out of their investment in digital. What makes digital so much harder than other transformations, and what have some companies learned that has helped them beat the odds? Among the reasons that many efforts struggle: • lack of focus on scaling the few cases that will make the difference • pursuing technology for technology’s sake, without a clear business problem statement • inability to scale pilots that succeeded in controlled environments, but were too fragile to accommodate real-world conditions in the field • unclear accountabilities and governance that employed a clear strategy and roadmap, but had little follow-through because the line leadership wasn’t bought in • difficulty sustaining, so after a couple months, as the impact deteriorates, teams went back to old ways of working • too much risk that made it difficult to experiment if the cost of failure seemed too high • lack of change management, particularly in painting a compelling picture of what the positive future will look like. Some critical stakeholders worried about the impact of digital change on individuals or didn’t buy into the benefits digital has to offer The details may differ, but the themes are consistent: not enough buy-in from the front line, not prioritizing the digital effort, failure to scale and sustain, and, ultimately, results that don’t flow to the bottom line. Making business transformation the goal By contrast, companies that have successfully scaled their digital initiatives treat these as critical business transformations. The ones that scale and stick are those that embody the business goals of the initiative, deploy technology in the service of those goals, and ensure continuous sponsorship and accountability. In our work, four actions have been crucial for scaling digital transformations. Focus on value. Since digital transformations are really business transformations, they need to focus on business priorities and scale the few initiatives that will create the most value. It may seem obvious to focus on problems that deliver results, but transformations often gravitate toward the issues that can be solved rather than what the company should solve. Teams need to avoid becoming distracted by technology opportunities that don’t sustain or create value or are too complex to rapidly deliver results. Better to focus on initial cases that combine high value with ease of deployment to 75 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition build momentum, and over time graduate to more complex situations. This demonstrates the value of implementation and scaling and begins to build a track record. One energy company that had run several pilot projects found it was getting very little return on its investment and solving few business problems. A fresh analysis identified boiler reliability as critical to efficiency. While there was pressure to chase a technology solution for predictive maintenance, the team deconstructed the problem and decided this was one case to scale because it delivered significant value. It then launched pilots that mixed traditional condition monitoring with advanced analytics. Within three months, this initiative identified several subcomponents on the brink of failure, which it avoided through preventative maintenance, saving enough to cover the cost of the project up to that point. It then went on to target benefits equivalent to 10% of the asset group’s value. The lesson for this group: Focus on what creates value and don’t feel compelled to develop a completely advanced solution if a mixture of traditional and new measures will get the job done. Prepare to scale from Day 1. Initiatives are more likely to scale across the company when designed with that goal in mind. For example, a mining company began transforming its operations by looking for similarities in technology infrastructure, capabilities, and the constraints and pain points in its production processes that could unlock material value. This helped the company identify a set of scaling vectors—that is, repeatable themes (for example, business problem, situation, technology, and capabilities) that it could scale rapidly, allowing it to gain valuable experience quickly. Taking the example of operations, these scaling vectors can be along specific production assets, a process, or a piece of equipment that can be repeated across the organization. Other scaling vectors may focus on technology similarities and capabilities, or even simply a repeatable approach or capability for deploying the application. Orchestrate to enable speed. Digital transformations are more cross-functional than other improvement efforts, and they often demand new capabilities. So it’s critical to update the operating model in ways that provide transparency, alignment, and clarity on decision making for a range of issues, including priorities, funding, partnerships, and resource deployment. If possible, go with the grain of the organization’s existing operating model. It helps to stand up a team that can design pilots that can be scaled up rather than retrofitted once they’re in motion. A chemical company had been working on its digital transformation for more than a year but was having trouble scaling up from low-impact pilots. Each plant had unique challenges and preferred its own, customized solutions, which led to complex decisions about resources and funding between the center and operations. Three changes in the digital operating model moved the company forward. • First, it put in place dedicated scaling teams to support delivery, propagate knowledge across units, and anticipate technology and capability requirements. 76 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2021: Navigating the Energy Transition • Second, it put a strong leadership governance in place with clear focus on three solutions that created 80% of the value, with a central budget to support the first wave of deployments. • Third, it launched a change and engagement approach, including storytelling that captured hearts and minds. The changes helped the company save more than €30 million over the first six months—50% above target savings—primarily through use of analytics that optimized processes and improved productivity. The program is on track to save three times that amount over the next three years. Operationalize to sustain value. When new technologies or processes don’t fit into the way work gets done, the innovation can sit unused by the front line. Successful transformations preempt this problem by designing for and selectively rewiring processes to take advantage of the digital innovation—that is, operationalizing it to create closed feedback loops from the field and capture all the intended value. This includes investing in capabilities that will let the company take advantage of an opportunity when it arrives, whether that’s hiring the right talent or fostering a culture that encourages innovation and risk taking, or adapting the funding or procurement model to implement digital programs at speed. Companies can then invest more confidently in disruptive change, which could be new technology, a new line of business, or an entirely new business model. One petroleum company identified an opportunity to improve its yield. In doing so, it developed a repeatable advanced analytics and Agile method that could be used across multiple manufacturing assets. The company operationalized and sustained the program by embedding the method in governance and ongoing business rhythms, while ensuring sponsorship from senior business and line leadership, communicating the need for the change, and setting up forums to share successes and learn from failures. The costs of implementing digital continue to fall as technologies mature and as companies and their people gain experience working with technology. As energy and natural resources companies work to enable the energy and resource transition, the benefits of digital technology—cost reduction, improved productivity, greater accuracy, and new business opportunities will undoubtedly be key enablers to making positive change while maintaining a competitive edge.

The findings make us cautiously optimistic. ENR companies are investing as much in innovation and impact, combined, as they are in economics—a good sign that executives are investing in the future. Fewer than 15% of capital investment decisions are characterized as made solely on an economic basis. The large profits that some energy companies earned during the first months of 2022 are likely to sharpen focus on capital decisions, as executives work to get the balance right between funding the current business, investing in the future, and rewarding shareholders. The report has three sections: • Data-based insights. Our surveys of more than 1,000 executives, a new database tracking the investment decisions of the top 125 ENR companies (covering more than $6 trillion in market capitalization), and more than 30 hours of interviews with investment professionals give us a full-spectrum view of the energy and natural resources sector’s intent, actions, and reactions. • Meaningful trends. We take a closer look at three critical areas where developments are reshaping the way ENR companies approach their business: talent management, engaging with stakeholders, and circularity. • Essential capabilities. We report on the evolving nature of five critical capabilities essential to navigating the transitions underway. These include flexible and more nimble strategies, an openness to M&A and partnerships, and new perspectives on operations, inflationary pricing, and sustainability. Based on our work with clients and observations of the dramatic progress made by the readers of this report over the past year, we’re sanguine about the outlook for the value to be created and the contributions to be made in the ENR space in the coming decades. It will surely continue to be a challenging ride, but we look forward to continuing to work with you and continuing the discussion.

By Peter Parry, Neelam Phadke, Alasdair Robbie, and Joseph Scalise In conversations with our clients over the past year, we’ve seen a marked shift in what the energy and resource transition means for their businesses. Not so long ago, the energy transition was a set of challenges that could compromise long-term strategic planning. Over the past 12 months, the change-oriented executive teams we work with have moved from just thinking about the challenges to taking action along a path they now see with greater clarity. However, after an optimistic start, many are beginning to hit heavy traffic as they grapple with the increased complexity of delivering on ever greater resource needs with a green footprint. To quantify what we’re seeing, we surveyed more than 1,000 client executives across the energy and natural resources sector. We wanted a better understanding of their views on the energy and resource transition; new technologies and opportunities; and where they see environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) challenges in addition to decarbonization. The results confirm many of the trends we see, with more richness. • Industry is moving more quickly than policy. – Executives expect their companies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 28% by 2030. – On average, they expect the world to reach net zero by 2057. 7 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 • Most are more bullish about their own companies’ decarbonization, compared with what they expect from peers and the world at large, which might indicate a greater commitment than the outside world can see. • Half of oil and gas executives expect their core business to decline in the next 10 years. And 72% of O&G respondents believe they’ll have a new growth business that will complement (62%) or replace (10%) their core by 2030. • Across sectors, companies now report allocating 23% of their capital to new business ventures, mostly in response to the energy and resource transition, up from 16% when asked in 2020. If this trend continues, it suggests many could reach net zero well ahead of 2050. • And, they expect it to make a difference: just under half expect their companies to be “materially different” by 2030, up from 36% in 2020. • Most are still struggling to figure out business models for their new businesses that will deliver adequate returns, attract talent, and strengthen their organizational capabilities. • Compared with their European counterparts, North American oil and gas respondents are nearly twice as likely to be delaying investment in new business areas due to policy and regulatory uncertainties. • The data also reveals a growing consensus that, in light of these many challenges, the transition will be disorderly. We see excitement and ambition across the board, with individuals having greater faith in their firms’ abilities and plans than the market at large. In the data that follows, we dive into these topics. The results represent a global view of our clients’ perspectives, with responses from 45 countries across three major regions: the Americas; Asia-Pacific; and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. At least 10% of the responses come from each of these five sectors: oil and gas, utilities and renewables, mining, agribusiness, and chemicals. This data also covers a range of perspectives within companies. Just over half of responses came from vice presidents or higher, including C-level executives and board members, with the rest from individual contributors and frontline management. From these responses, we see excitement and ambition across the board, with individuals having greater faith in their firms’ abilities and plans than the market at large. 8 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 However, the data underlines that there’s still a tremendous amount of ground left to cover. And as executive teams ramp up to deliver even more output, some are finding it challenging to square the traditional demands of their business—delivering products safely, securely, reliably, and affordably— with new demands to operate more sustainably and with a smaller carbon and ecological footprint. For example, within the utilities sector, greater competition has squeezed returns from renewables, and the importance of grid reliability has become clearer with intermittency issues in Texas and Europe. Consumers around the world are feeling the pain of high energy costs. As companies try to succeed in new markets, they’re facing new challenges such as finding the right talent and navigating the policy regimes. As executive teams ramp up to deliver even more output, some are finding it challenging to square the traditional demands of their business—delivering products safely, securely, reliably, and affordably—with new demands to operate more sustainably and with a smaller carbon and ecological footprint. Our survey provides keen insight into what’s on the minds of energy and resource executives as they navigate difficult and disrupted paths through the energy and resource transition. Their views show evidence of positive trajectories for investment, technology, and new business growth, but also highlight the need for more attention on how to deliver, as well as the sometimes-fragile link between policy and providers. 9 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 01 Emissions reduction Executives overwhelmingly believe that reducing carbon emissions and reaching net zero are top priorities. say reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions is a key priority for their company 88% say that a net-zero commitment is critical 79% expect their company to change significantly in the next 10 years (up from 36% in 2020) 47% expect their industry to make progress toward net zero by 2030 96% 88% give meaningful weight (at least 10%) to each imperative 02 Innovation, impact, and economics Executives believe all three are important.

By Brian Murphy, Peter Parry, Neelam Phadke, and Alasdair Robbie Data-rich perspectives Investing in New Growth Businesses At a Glance For many companies in the energy and natural resources sector, the path to success depends on investing in new growth businesses—what we call Engine 2. Companies whose core businesses are most affected by the energy and resource transition are investing most aggressively. Many of these Engine 2 businesses are low-carbon ventures, including renewable power generation, carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen, and new forms of electric mobility. These investments are blurring business boundaries, such as European oil and gas companies investing heavily in renewable power generation and electric vehicle charging stations. 16 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 For many energy and mining companies, big reductions in emissions in recent years have resulted from divestments: selling their most carbon-intensive assets to new owners, often with less-visible portfolios. Of course, this did nothing to reduce global emissions, since most of these assets will continue to operate under new owners. It did, however, provide capital to the sellers, more than $100 billion per year that the sector could invest in a number of ways, including new growth businesses that might have a smaller carbon footprint than the assets that were sold. That would line up with what we’re hearing and seeing from our large energy and natural resources clients, as more of them start to develop opportunities in low-carbon business. Some are moving faster than others, hoping to establish leading positions in these new growth businesses, which Bain calls “Engine 2.” We set out to quantify this movement by developing a definitive data set on the strategy and resource allocation of 125 of the top energy and natural resources (ENR) firms by market capitalization, analyzing their public statements, annual reports, and analyst reports. We wanted to determine how much their actions support what they’re saying publicly and what they told us in our recent survey (see the first chapter in this report, “How Energy and Resource Executives Think about the Transition”). Our research found that over the past two years, these companies have become more ambitious in new markets and are allocating resources toward their lower-carbon goals (see Figure 1). Utilities are Figure 1: Utilities and oil & gas companies expect to spend more on new growth businesses over the next 10 years Utilities Oil and gas 2020 $2.6B 38% 2030 3.0 37% 0.8 Share of 11% total capex 2.4 20% Notes: Not all companies announce Engine 2 investment; data shows average capex for companies that report spending on new growth businesses Sources: Bain analysis of 125 top energy and natural resource companies; S&P Capital IQ; company and analyst reports; Dealogic Average capex on Engine 2 per company ($B) 17 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 already spending a lot, oil and gas companies are scaling up, and companies in mining, chemicals, and agriculture are still in the early phases of change. The greater resources of large oil and gas companies could enable them to catch up quickly with the utilities sector, once their plans solidify (see Figure 2). More investment will be needed over the next decade to reach their targets and net-zero carbon emissions, but their plans are coming into sharper focus. If oil prices remain high, these companies will have more funds to deploy, which could accelerate investments in new growth businesses. Sectors are responding differently, depending on how their core products are threatened. • Utilities and oil and gas companies are in the eye of the storm, under intense pressure to change their methods of production or products. They’re investing in and converging on some of the same end markets, with companies reporting an average of four or five Engine 2s in development (see Figure 3). • Chemicals firms are concentrating much of their effort and research investments on circularity— specifically, how to address the plastic waste problem by recycling more plastics or developing bio-based products. Some of these solutions will invite new collaborations with companies in customer sectors, including automotive and consumer products. This challenge may not be an existential threat to their industries, as carbon reduction is in oil and gas. But the chemicals and plastics producers are probably the natural owners of the solutions. Figure 2: Oil and gas has the resources to match and exceed the utility sector’s investments in renewables Sources: Bain analysis of 125 top energy and natural resource companies; S&P Capital IQ Industry spending ($B) 0 100 200 300 400 2017 18 19 20 21 2017 18 19 20 21 $500B Capex Dividends Buybacks Oil and gas Utilities 18 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 • Agribusiness and mining are under less direct threat, except for coal. Both sectors are focused on reducing carbon in operations and otherwise improving sustainability in operations, including using less water. Companies are also investing in new, sustainable products. In agribusiness, that could be alternative proteins or digital platforms that help with food chain traceability. In mining, it may be supplying transition commodities, low-carbon inputs to metals, or even metal recycling. The takeaway is that companies that aren’t yet investing seriously in new growth businesses may be falling behind. But it’s still early in the game. A look at how other companies and industries are investing can help companies develop their next moves (for more on developing Engine 2, see Chapter 8, “How to Do Engine 2”). Where ENR firms are placing bets Our analysis of these leading energy and natural resource companies reveals three types of investments in Engine 2. • Big bets. Aiming for market leadership or expecting Engine 2 to be as important as the core business. • Hedged or measured. Investing in a new market, but with less grand ambitions than for their big bets. • Exploratory. Evaluating the potential in a new market, but it’s not yet a major strategic focus. Figure 3: Sectors are investing in line with the effects that the energy and resource transition will have on their core businesses Notes: Not all companies announce Engine 2 investments; data shows investments for companies that report spending on new growth businesses Sources: Bain analysis of 125 top energy and natural resource companies; S&P Capital IQ: company and analyst reports; Dealogic Average number of investments in new growth businesses per company Utilities 4.4 Oil and gas 4.0 Chemicals 2.8 Mining 1.3 1.6 Agribusiness Hedged or measured: already a market presence, or expects new business to be important to company’s future Exploratory: evaluating potential, but not a major strategic focus Big bets: aims to lead market, expects Engine 2 to be as important as core business Significant repositioning required Diversification to benefit from new growth vectors Focus on adapting core for future growth 19 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 We see big bets, the most aggressive investments, most commonly in areas where an incumbent sees enough potential to replace its legacy business in the future, or where there’s a natural adjacency that offers a viable path to meaningful scale (see Figure 4). Hedged or measured bets are on businesses that will be part of the future portfolio but aren’t expected to displace the core. Exploratory plays are seen in more nascent profit pools, or where the potential is still undefined. Utilities. Utilities continue to invest in renewable power generation, which is already an economical alternative for them to provide their core product (electricity) with fewer carbon emissions—albeit typically with lower returns. Meanwhile, many are exploring new businesses in services and distributed systems. Enel, for example, is investing to fully decarbonize its power generation by 2040 through expanding renewables, and simultaneously expanding into efficient energy management through tech and services via its Enel X platform. Oil and gas. New policies and social pressures are shaping the investments of oil and gas companies. • European majors, facing greater regulatory pressure on Scope 3 emissions, are investing aggressively in renewables, hydrogen, and biofuels. Shell, for example, aims to produce 560 terawatt hours of renewable electricity and establish a network of 2.5 million electric vehicle (EV) charging points globally, while also building out hydrogen, carbon capture use and storage (CCUS), and a sustainable aviation fuel business. TotalEnergies aims to generate a combined Figure 4: Companies facing the greatest threats to their core are investing most aggressively in new businesses Note: Categories with asterisks represent themes not primarily motivated by the energy transition Sources: Bain analysis of 125 top energy and natural resource companies; S&P Capital IQ; company and analyst reports; Dealogic Utilities Oil and gas Chemicals Agribusiness Mining Exploratory Evaluating potential, but not a major strategic focus Hedged or measured Already a market presence, or expects new business to be important to company’s future Big bets Aims to lead market, expects Engine 2 to be as important as core business Electric vehicles and mobility Renewables Hydrogen Storage Services (e.g., electricity sales, smart homes) Carbon capture use and storage (CCUS) Bio-based products Agrinutrients* Circularity Health and nutrition* Advanced materials (e.g., 5G materials, 3-D printing)* Alternative protein Services (e.g., agritech)* Green metals and cement Renewables Transition commodities (e.g., lithium) CCUS Circularity Low-carbon fuels 20 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 20% of its revenue in 2030 from renewables, biomass, and hydrogen, and another 50% from gas to reduce its reliance on oil. • Oil companies in the US are focused on producing more and cleaner oil, gas, and refined products, while making bets on biofuels and CCUS. Chevron aims to capture 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year and recently announced its acquisition of Renewable Energy Group for over $3 billion to help reach its goal of producing 100,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel by 2030. • National oil companies follow the priorities of their parent government. Saudi Aramco, for example, is pursuing low-carbon hydrogen. Chemicals is a diverse sector, but we’re seeing two broad themes. Some companies are investing in more sustainable ways to make or market current products, such as making plastics more recyclable or bio-based. We’re also seeing investments in new products and markets, some resulting from the energy transition and others from new technologies (such as materials for 5G networks). BASF aims to double the sales from its circular economy solutions business to €17 billion by 2030. The takeaway is that companies that aren’t yet investing seriously in new growth businesses may be falling behind. But it’s still early in the game. A look at how other companies and industries are investing can help companies develop their next moves. Agribusiness is a more highly fragmented growth industry and may not face the same existential threat to its core business as oil and gas does. But these companies are investing in new business to capture some new opportunities and improve operations. Specifically, we see new investments along three themes. First, they’re investing in greater sustainability, in food products like alternative proteins, and in inputs, like renewable fuel feedstock and bio-based fertilizers. Second, they’re investing in markets that promote better health and nutrition, in part to appeal to consumers who want more transparency in their food sourcing. And they’re building up their digital capabilities to tap into new asset-light business models like Olam’s AtSource, which traces the supply chain from grower to customer. Mining. Many coal assets have been divested by larger companies, and those that have retained them have clear plans to ramp down. Outside of coal, there’s limited direct threat to mining’s core business. Some of the global mining majors are orienting their portfolios to take advantage of rising demand for minerals associated with the energy transition, including staples like copper, aluminium, and nickel, along with new moves into lithium and rare earth minerals. 21 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Blurred business boundaries and the basis for competition This rapid redefinition of the energy landscape is blurring traditional boundaries between sectors, particularly in five areas (see Figure 5). • Renewables. European oil and gas firms like BP and Total are investing in power generation, competing with incumbent utilities. Some chemicals and mining companies are collaborating with utilities to develop clean energy for their operations. • Hydrogen infrastructure. Oil and gas, utilities, chemicals, agribusiness, mining, and industrial gases are all investing to capture share at various points along the value chain. • Electric vehicle charging stations. In Europe, utilities are racing with oil and gas companies to build networks of stations. (In the US, some states limit utilities’ abilities to pursue retail recharging stations or other downstream opportunities.) Many European utilities (Eon, Iberdrola, Enel) have ambitions to serve this end of the value chain. At the same time, oil and gas players (BP, Total, Shell) see a natural opportunity here; instead of providing gasoline through a pump to a fuel tank, they want to convert their retail network to provide electrons to EVs. Figure 5: Companies across sectors are converging on a limited set of opportunities, creating new arenas of competition Sources: Bain analysis of 125 top energy and natural resource companies; S&P Capital IQ; company and analyst reports; Dealogic Profit pool Renewables Hydrogen Electric vehicle charging Low-carbon fuels Carbon capture use and storage Sector Examples Oil and gas TotalEnergies targets 100GW of renewable generation capacity by 2030 Oil and gas Shell aims to possess 10%+ share of global green hydrogen sales by 2030 Utilities Iberdrola seeks to nearly triple its renewable capacity to 95GW by 2030 Utilities Engie targets 4GW of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030 Agribusiness Yara and partners providing renewable energy to produce green ammonia for fertilizer and industrial markets, and new applications such as marine shipping fuel Chemicals Air Products partnering with Saudi Armaco and ACWA Power on $12B hydrogen and power project including $5B green hydrogen plant Mining Fortescue Future Industries, subsidiary of Fortescue Mining Group, aspires to produce 15M tons of green hydrogen by 2030 Utilities Engie aims for 1M charging points by 2025, from 350K today Oil and gas Shell plans 500K charging points globally by 2025 and 2.5M by 2030, from 90K today Oil and gas BP seeks 20% share of the global market for synthetic fuel by 2030 Utilities Engie is aiming for 10% share of biomethane market in France via Engie BioZ Chemicals Albemarle’s ReNewFine is a chemical used in the hydrotreating step of the biorefining process Agribusiness Bunge recently partnered with Chevron on a biofuel joint venture Oil and gas Occidental recently sold the first barrel of net-zero oil, with carbon emissions offset via direct-air capture Chemicals BASF’s OASE Blue is a gas-treatment chemical used to capture CO2 in chemical processes 22 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 • Low-carbon fuels. Here again, we see interest and ambition from oil and gas, chemicals, utilities, and even agribusiness companies. • Carbon capture use and storage. Oil and gas players are most active in the CCUS landscape, but the ambitions for technologies vary. Some see CCUS as an opportunity to virtually decarbonize their existing product; by capturing atmospheric carbon as an offset, they can go to market with “net-zero oil.” Others are seeking to commercialize CCUS as a service. Chemicals companies are also providing the inputs needed to capture carbon. The basis of competition in each market isn’t clear yet, and companies that haven’t traditionally been competitors are now elbowing for market leadership positions. For example, 9 of the top 10 players in renewable generation capacity in 2020 were large power utility companies, but by 2030 at least 3 of the large oil majors are expected to move into the top 10 renewable players, per announced investment plans (see Figure 6). Moves like this will require new capabilities, and incumbents are increasingly turning to partnerships, joint ventures, and acquisitions as an important tool to develop their Engine 2 businesses (see Figure 7). Scale M&A can be challenging, given the nascent nature of new energy markets, but smaller acquisitions (below $5 billion) and effective partnerships remain important for developing new Figure 6: Some oil and gas companies are investing heavily in renewable power generation, which will change the makeup of the leader board Sources: Bain analysis of 125 top energy and natural resource companies; S&P Capital IQ; company and analyst reports; Dealogic Renewables capacity of 10 largest providers of renewable energy (GW) 0 20 40 60 80 100% 2020 197 1 2030 734 3 Oil and gas Utilities Oil and gas companies in the top 10 23 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 businesses. The high valuations for some clean tech assets can be difficult to justify when weighed against potential returns for deploying capital in the core business. Partnerships are critical but are no substitute for a clear, well-developed strategy. Challenges greater than expected While companies are aggressively investing, it’s too early to declare success, and there are plenty of challenges in executing to deliver these ambitions. As noted in our survey, executives are grappling with the challenge of generating returns from these new ventures. Even on its own, the task of navigating the energy and resource transition would be an unprecedented challenge for most energy and natural resources companies (see Figure 8). The added complexities of pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, rising trade barriers, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, dramatic spikes in commodity prices, and accelerating pressure from investors and capital markets are testing the abilities of every senior team and executive in these industries. The landscape is far more challenging than anticipated, and it’s not going to get any easier. Nevertheless, our research shows that many Engine 2 successes have sprung from turbulent times, rewriting the rules and revealing new profit pools. Within many large ENR companies, Engine 2 Figure 7: M&A is emerging as a critical tool for accessing talent, capabilities, and markets for new growth businesses Sources: Bain analysis of 125 top energy and natural resource companies; S&P Capital IQ; company and analyst reports; Dealogic Number of merger and acquisition deals in Engine 2 growth areas Utilities Mining 2018 25 2021 35 9 30 12 19 9 13 2 6 Oil and gas Chemicals Agribusiness 24 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 organizations are being established and equipped with the talent and resources needed to meet customer needs, scale quickly, and obtain the capital necessary to deliver on 2030 targets. For them, the status quo won’t be good enough. One truth already seems clear: Successful new businesses will require many large companies to adopt an insurgent position. If some fast-moving, forward-looking, nimble attacker is going to cannibalize your business, better that it be one from inside your own organization.

By Grant Dougans, Debra McCoy, Peter Parry, Luis Uriza, and Chung Yen Wong Data-rich perspectives Meeting the Needs of Capital and Energy Markets At a Glance More investors are considering the energy transition and other ESG issues in their investment decisions. We asked 89 energy investors (45 focused on utilities and 44 on oil and gas) how these factors affect their portfolios. Investors are bullish on the utilities sector. They see electrification as a growth opportunity, and they want management teams to capture the moment. Despite the recent rise of oil and gas prices, investors are more restrained about the long-term prospects for that sector. They want management teams to continue generating cash and exercising capital discipline. Many investors are considering using carbon emissions limits, reduction targets, or ESG rankings to guide their portfolio decisions in the future. 26 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 With changes in capital markets coming to the forefront of executive agendas, we and our partner Rivel, an investor research firm, recently interviewed 89 investors and analysts about how the energy transition is shaping investment decisions in the energy sector. We found that the transition is squarely at the center of the agenda for investors, and that it shapes perspectives on individual companies as well as sectors. As a result, the “to dos” for executive teams in utilities and in oil and gas are very different. For all companies, we found that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) goals are important, and every company must bring a compelling story to the table. Investors expect companies to reduce carbon emissions, particularly the Scope 1 and 2 emissions that they largely control. Most of the investors we spoke with aren’t placing fixed limits or exclusions in portfolios on the basis of their carbon emissions, but that could change. For all companies, we found that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) goals are important, and every company must bring a compelling story to the table. Ensuring that strategy—and the execution of the strategy—remains aligned with evolving capital market expectations is a critical and increasingly central task for executive teams. Investor perspectives on utilities Electrification plays a leading role in achieving a net-zero future, and utilities worldwide stand to benefit from ample investment opportunities (see Figure 1). Investors and analysts believe in the long-term growth potential of the utilities sector, and they’re looking for management teams with the strategy and execution capabilities to capture the moment. Investors want leadership teams that can: • capture opportunities from the growth in renewable power generation; • accelerate electric vehicle adoption; and • maximize returns for every dollar of capital deployed. 27 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 In order to do this, executive teams need to mitigate three critical risks. • Affordability for customers • Reliability of service and intermittency issues • Regulator and stakeholder risk The investors we interviewed believe in the utility sector and the stability of the utility model (see Figure 2). The most commonly cited factor determining investment decisions is management credibility (93%). Investor and analyst perspectives on oil and gas Over the past 18 months, the oil and gas sector has witnessed a landmark set of shareholder votes, a critical court ruling directing Shell to accelerate carbon reductions, the COP26 climate conference, and the expansion of net-zero financial alliances. At the same time, commodity prices have surged, pressures to expand production have intensified, and oil and gas companies’ share prices have outperformed broad indices. Figure 1: In utilities, investors see opportunities in renewables and electrification, but are most concerned about affordability and reliability Sources: Rivel survey of North American and European investment professionals, 2021 (n=89); Bain & Company Percentage of respondents who cited these factors Growth of renewables 42% More electricity for EVs 36% Increased reinvestment/ capex opportunities 36% Affordability for customers during transition 49% Reliability of service/ intermittency issues 38% Managing regulatory risk 24% Opportunities Risks 28 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 In this dynamic environment, three core messages emerged from our discussions with investors and analysts that should have long-term resonance for oil and gas executive teams. First, investors and analysts are clearly looking for oil and gas executive teams to remain focused on cash generation and maintain disciplined deployment of capital. Of the 10 factors we tested in our conversations, oil and gas production growth was the least important factor determining investment decisions (see Figure 3). Second, investors see both opportunities and risks associated with how oil and gas companies respond to the energy transition (see Figure 4). They see the potential to use the industry’s capabilities in new, lower-carbon markets, but they’re also concerned about how capital is allocated. Demonstrating how strategy and execution respond to these perspectives should be at the center of oil and gas strategies and investor communications. Third, investors are open to oil and gas companies participating in lower-carbon markets (see Figure 5). In the context of uncertainty about the pace and shape of the energy transition, there’s value in showing investors the company has plans for growth in a lower-carbon world. Rules and limits in portfolios: carbon budgets and ESG We’ve been wondering about carbon emissions and whether they play a consistent role in portfolio construction. We’re specifically interested in potential portfolio rules governing carbon emissions, Figure 2: Most investors agree on the factors that influence their decisions in utilities Sources: Rivel survey of North American and European investment professionals, 2021 (n=89); Bain & Company Compelling energy transition strategy 67% 33% Favorable regulatory environment 71% 29% Good potential for regulated earnings growth transmission and distribution 81% 13% 4% Management credibility 93% 7% 2% Highly important Somewhat important Not as important Uncertain 29 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Figure 3: For oil and gas, cash flow is the most important investment factor and potential growth in production ranks 10th Oil and gas production growth 16% 48% 30% 7% Strong balance sheet 65% 25% 5% 5% Track record of shareholder return 73% 20% 2%5% Track record of capital discipline 79% 16% 5% Reliable cash flow 82% 11% 2%5% Sources: Rivel survey of North American and European investment professionals, 2021 (n=89); Bain & Company Highly important Somewhat important Not as important Uncertain Figure 4: For oil and gas, investors see opportunities in lower-carbon markets, but are concerned about capital allocation and declining demand Sources: Rivel survey of North American and European investment professionals, 2021 (n=89); Bain & Company Percentage of respondents who cited these factors Lead the transition with core capabilities and market positions 41% Supply/demand benefits, rising prices due to the slow pace of transition 36% Carbon capture 25% Maintaining appropriate capex levels 30% Lower returns/ how will they make money? 27% Opportunities Risks Declining demand in oil and gas 20% 30 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 and efforts to target and reduce them. To learn more, we asked a series of questions to uncover possible changes in investor decision making. We learned that nearly 20% of utilities investors and 13% of oil and gas investors have fixed, emissions-based guidelines that use limits or exclusions in their portfolios to set parameters for what they can own (see Figures 6 and 7). When asked about carbon limits or reduction targets in portfolio guidelines, 13% of utilities investors and 6% of oil and gas investors reported already having such goals. In both sectors, 16% of investors are considering limits or reduction targets. While carbon limits aren’t a determining factor in portfolio decisions today, we found it important to learn that some investors are considering it for the future—and not just in these two sectors, but across investment choices. The investors we spoke with give ESG prominent consideration in their investment decisions, but there are differences in how important they believe these factors are and how they use ESG ratings and rankings in their portfolios. More than 70% of investors across utilities and oil and gas described ESG as either very important or important (see Figure 8). ESG ratings are sometimes used to create rules and limits. Utilities investors are more likely to embed ESG ratings into portfolio decisions: 29% vs. 10% of oil and gas investors (see Figure 9).

The path forward Our research with Rivel shows that the energy transition is increasingly central to how investors and analysts view energy and natural resources. For utilities, this is the time to be on the front foot with investors and to deploy bold, innovative strategies to enable more investment in their jurisdictions. Oil and gas companies, on the other hand, will want to manage and evolve their investor value propositions carefully. Investors are looking to the sector to generate cash; some companies may exploit near-term demand for oil and gas to build capital. Investors are waiting to see if the capital will be returned or used for transformative change. For executives in both sectors, embarking on any new, low-carbon energy businesses will require a clear connection to the principles of the core business. Now more than ever, they’ll need to show how their capabilities, expertise, and customer relationships make them the best owner of the new business. For executives in both sectors, embarking on any new, low-carbon energy businesses will require a clear connection to the principles of the core business. These findings represent a snapshot in time. The capital markets and energy transition landscapes remain dynamic. How will asset managers in the net-zero financial coalitions incorporate ESG, carbon, and science-based targets into their investing decisions? Will certain companies or categories of energy infrastructure become less “investible” as a result? What happens then, to individual companies and energy markets? (For more, see the Bain Brief “Managing Stranded Costs on the Long Road to Net Zero.”) Executive teams should stress-test their strategy and decisions against the answers to these questions, while keeping a close watch on developments in capital markets. 34 Forming a series of tailored scenarios can help prepare for volatility in commodity supplies and shifting trade blocs. By Jorge Leis, Stuart Love, Peter Parry, Dave Rennard, and Michael Short Data-rich perspectives How Companies Are Responding to the Crisis in Ukraine At a Glance Energy and natural resources companies have moved past their initial shock over the war in Ukraine and are integrating new economic and commodity-flow realities into their planning. Resilience can be expensive, so executives need to determine where it makes the most sense to invest, particularly in long-term investments in energy and resources. Identifying disruptions at three levels—commodity, macroeconomic, and policy—helps companies see how their businesses will be affected. By tailoring scenarios of plausible disruptions and outcomes, companies can prepare for a range of possible outcomes. 35 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 As the war in Ukraine grinds on, companies and their leadership teams have moved past their initial reactions of shock in order to integrate the crisis into their medium- and long-term planning. The war is a continuing tragedy, but also—when viewed through the lens of corporate strategy— an extreme example in a string of global disruptions that seem to be coming faster, more frequently, and with greater intensity than they once did. For most companies, a critical component of their response to the crisis is finding ways to make their businesses, operations, and supply chains more resilient. It’s becoming increasingly prudent to prioritize resilience over low cost or efficiency. “Just in time” has been replaced by “just in case.” Resilience is critical, but resilience is also expensive. For longer-term survival, companies still need to pay attention to the basic principles of leadership: innovation, impact, and economics. But as they recover from the initial shock and begin to make longer-term plans, companies need to answer the question: Where is resilience worth the cost? For most companies, a critical component of their response to the crisis is finding ways to make their businesses, operations, and supply chains more resilient. It’s becoming increasingly prudent to prioritize resilience over low cost or efficiency. “Just in time” has been replaced by “just in case.” The answers differ for each company. Getting it right requires at least two things. First, companies need to develop a comprehensive understanding of their vulnerabilities to a range of disruptions, including risks to people, business continuity, asset economics, and financial performance. In some cases, these risks may originate two or three steps away from their typical planning view. For most companies in the energy and natural resources sectors, the response requires understanding the supply-side shocks affecting the commodities for which Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus play a key role in production and trade (see Figure 1). These supply challenges will restructure trade flows while also invigorating domestic alternatives. The second step aims at longer-term insights and better decision making. Questions like, “Where is resilience worth the cost?” and, “Can I respond to today’s shortage with a major new capital investment?” are best considered in the context of scenarios that reflect a set of plausible outcomes. By developing a set of tailored scenarios specifically anchored on those potential disruptions and their associated uncertainty, companies lay the groundwork for repositioning their organizations to thrive in a rapidly shifting business environment. 36 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Scenario planning Companies can map out potential impacts using scenario planning to aggregate different trajectories of the business environment. For example, a return to globalized trade would be characterized by short-term disruption to commodities, modest macroeconomic effects, and a renewed emphasis on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) considerations. Although similar to conditions a year ago, this scenario would still be more cautious than before Russia invaded Ukraine, recognizing resource security as a priority. In a fractured scenario, the world is changing, and the invasion would be the latest manifestation of that change, marking an end to the efficient trade of a globalized world, and the beginning of a world fractured into nearly independent trade blocs. In this scenario, loss of efficiency drives up commodity prices. Trade blocs would focus on security of supply, creating redundancy and increasing global demand. Supply chains and global trade would be severely disrupted, but growth possible. Companies would find that sanctions and national interests govern their operations more than in the past. Companies in the energy and natural resources sectors will feel the disruption of these scenarios at three different levels. • Commodity level, affecting the local and global market conditions specific to each commodity and market (for example, European gas demand, global wheat pricing). 0 25 50 75 100% Sources: UN Comtrade; Refinitiv; US Department of Agriculture; BP; International Fertilizer Association; Nutrien; DTN; US Geological Survey; Bain & Company Methanol Barley Sunflower oil Maize/corn Wheat Urea Ammonia Phosphates Potash Thermal coal Aluminum Palladium Finished nickel Copper Steel Natural gas Oil Share of world export value (%) Russia Ukraine Belarus Rest of world Mining Foods Oil and gas Agricultural chemicals Chemicals Figure 1: Percentage of global commodities produced by Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine 37 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 • Macroeconomic level, reflecting how commodity disruptions can affect the broader economy, including inflationary pressure or recession risk. • Policy and technology implications, including changes in taxes, the role of government spending and subsidies, and new technology developments. Commodity shortages and resulting price spikes quickly flow to downstream customers for whom these are key inputs (including manufacturing, power generation, fertilizers, and many others). Because some of these commodities (notably oil, gas, and food) are among the broadest inputs into the overall economy, all consumers will pay higher prices for consumer goods. The pressure on household budgets will drive government responses in the form of subsidies, tax relief, and other measures, to try to ease the burden on the general public, and those regulatory responses will feed back into the dynamics that companies face as they decide how to navigate this set of disruptions. In a fractured scenario, the world is changing, and the invasion would be the latest manifestation of that change, marking an end to the efficient trade of a globalized world, and the beginning of a world fractured into nearly independent trade blocs. Companies have been responding in real time and planning how to optimize their infrastructure and relationships for the near term. Now, for many, the planning cycle introduces an opportunity to explore how the conflict will alter near- and long-term decisions, especially influencing both the capital cycle and portfolio views. Over the next few months, it will be critical for companies to reexamine recent events through the lens of risk and opportunity. Some CEOs may determine that increasingly volatile business environments merit investing in greater resilience, while others may look for ways to pursue efficiency to undercut competitors when markets are favorable. Commodity level In the face of these disruptions, primary commodity producers are looking to increase capacity to displace Russian exports. Customers and finished-product companies are having to absorb price shocks and supply constraints, and midstream traders will need to forge new connections as markets react and evolve (see Figure 2). Business customers and governments are acting to address acute shortages. 38 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Markets will respond to the threat of commodity supply interruptions in four ways. • New sources of supply will replace those affected by sanctions or shifting trade routes. For example, European countries are making new agreements with Qatar and the US for liquefied natural gas (LNG) to replace piped gas from Russia. • Substitute goods provide alternatives. When Russian sunflower oil fell under sanctions, prices for Malaysian palm oil surged. • Reduced demand, whether resulting from high prices (as with some ammonia producers in Eastern Europe) or coordinated demand responses (such as the IEA’s call to set thermostats 1oC lower, to consume less gas). • Rerouting trade routes in response to sanctions and to supply emerging trade blocs. Japan and the EU, importers of both metallurgical and thermal coal from Russia, have begun sourcing from other locations such as Colombia, the US, Australia, and Indonesia. These changes carry risk for each commodity but may also create new opportunities that companies will need to navigate in an uncertain and rapidly evolving market environment. We’ll consider three fundamental inputs: gas, oil, and wheat.

Europe depends on Russia for 60% of its imported natural gas, and its imports consume 75% of Russia’s exported gas volume. The European Union has reacted quickly with proposals that could cut that dependence in half relatively quickly, even in a cautious scenario, reflecting Europe’s newfound concerns for energy security. The proposals rely heavily on bringing in alternative supplies in the form of international LNG, and more European purchases of LNG on the spot market will raise demand and prices beyond usual patterns. Substitution is possible in the near term by prolonging the life of nuclear plants that had been scheduled to shut down, and accelerating the queue of wind and solar projects (though these renewable sources remain intermittent without at-scale power storage, so they aren’t perfect substitutes). These substitutes can introduce power to the grid and partially offset demand for gas. Demand reduction is also in scope. Higher prices will reduce demand for natural gas. These high costs will present stiff challenges for gas-intensive European industries and provide opportunities for low-cost manufacturers, especially those that have cheaper gas and can export to European markets. Additional offsetting will be painful. In more extreme scenarios, this could mean not just higher costs, but also the risk of backsliding on environmental goals. Swapping coal or oil for gas could reduce dependence on Russian gas supplies, but at the cost of increasing carbon emissions. Even with these more painful measures, it will be difficult for Europe to reduce its dependence on Russian gas by much more than 60% within a year, meaning continued dependence on some 50 billion to 70 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian gas per year. Because Russia’s government is disproportionately funded by oil and gas, which together comprise only 7% of Russian GDP but about 40% of the government’s budget, both parties will want to see gas continue to flow, at least to fulfill existing contracts. It could take at least five years to fundamentally change this relationship, partly because the infrastructure will take that long to build. This mutual dependence explains Russia’s hesitation in terminating gas flows. Russia has tested the effectiveness of using its gas flows as a negotiating tactic in penalizing Poland and Finland, but market stability despite these moves indicates they are too small in the summer demand season to have a material impact. The invasion of Ukraine coincided with the end of the winter gas season, so low stocks and winter demand patterns created dramatic price spikes. The price of gas has subsequently settled at a high price, supporting a European program to acquire LNG and piped gas to restock storage. This effort has created a cushion to temper price effects from recent physical gas pipeline disruptions from both Russia and Ukraine. A prolonged or expanded outage, or an outage at another time of year, could have much more dire effects, however, and the market remains strained. The acute awareness of the importance of energy security clearly affects opportunities and risks for energy players. Gas and LNG suppliers may find good terms for contracting new capital projects. New pipelines that would have encountered public resistance a year ago may find a more hospitable regulatory process. Power rates, buoyed by gas prices, may help accelerate economics for new renewable 40 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 power projects. These tailwinds will run up against increased demand for hardware and energy services. In addition to other sources of inflation, this will drive higher costs of labor and materials, all of which will distort historical project economics. For energy consumers, especially those heavily dependent on gas, project economics will also shift. Companies weighing a potential move toward electrification to reduce their carbon footprint may find the decision easier in a world where gas prices are subject to occasional and prolonged spikes up to five times the historic average price. The value of hedging and long-term contracts may be greater going forward. And security of supply doesn’t necessarily translate to domestication of supply lines; expansion into lower-priced energy markets may present new avenues for growth. Oil. Russia supplied about 7.8 million barrels per day (mbd) of crude oil and refined products. About two-thirds of that flowed to countries that have backed the idea of sanctions; the US and the UK, followed by the rest of the G7, have already pledged to eliminate Russian imports, and the European Union may follow. The rest flows to countries that have not, including China, India, and some Central and Eastern European countries. Before Russia’s invasion, the price of oil was already rising as economies recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic. Crude oil prices rose from about $54 per barrel in January 2021 to $74 in December. Uncertainty in the wake of the invasion pushed crude oil prices over $120 per barrel, indicating a highly stressed market. If a substantial portion of Russia’s oil exports were to stay off the market indefinitely, prices could go higher. But it’s unlikely that a significant amount of Russian oil would disappear from global markets, which are fluid and porous. Oil tankers can be easily rerouted, and even sanctioned oil has a way of finding its way to market. Refined products are even easier to reroute than oil, and they make up about 2 mbd to 3 mbd of Russia’s total exports, much of which is likely to find markets. The share of Russian exports shipped with an unknown destination has increased dramatically, with much of this blended at sea to conceal its origin. Given this, in a cautious scenario, perhaps 1 million barrels of Russia’s daily export volume would be curtailed, an amount that’s relatively easy for the global market to adapt to. Sanctions from the US and European Union may be relatively easy to circumvent, even by lower- and middle-income countries that may be able to buy Russian liquids at a discount. Indeed, India has already increased its purchases of Russian crude, which trades at a discount of $30 or more per barrel. But Russian refineries are already reducing output due to the resistance in markets. In more extreme scenarios, as much as 4 mbd could struggle to find a market. Western capital could dry up, and we have already seen BP, Shell, Equinor, and Exxon announce their withdrawal from Russia. As depletion and depreciation take their toll, and as foreign know-how, expertise, and hardware become scarcer in the region, supply could decrease by 3 mbd, even without direct sanctions on the industry. 41 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 It doesn’t take a lot to move the market, though, and some markets are particularly vulnerable. Diesel was already in high demand due to Covid-related supply chain issues. Now, as European refiners turn down Russian crude and distributors forgo Russian diesel, European supply constraints become more pronounced. On top of this, desulfurizing diesel requires hydrogen from currently expensive natural gas. The result is a high and scarce diesel market that drives up logistics and machinery costs. Wheat. Russia and Ukraine play an important role in the global food chain (see Figure 3). In addition to exporting critical fertilizer ingredients such as ammonia, phosphate, and potash, they together make up about 14% of global wheat production and one-quarter of the global wheat trade. Much of this wheat ships to North Africa and the Middle East. Egypt, for example, is the world’s largest importer of wheat, importing nearly 60% of its wheat consumption, with about 80% of imports coming from Ukraine or Russia. Prices on the types of wheat that Russia and Ukraine export have risen, so Egypt and other importing countries will need to pay higher prices for wheat on the global market to feed vulnerable populations—one of many causes for concern. Wheat farmers in the Southern Hemisphere may be in a position to supplement some of the shortfall, benefiting from higher prices as they do. Shifting production from other crops to wheat could affect the prices of other commodities such as soy, barley, corn, and sunflowers, reducing volumes and raising prices. As the war continues, Northern Hemisphere farmers will soon face the same decisions in the next planting year, spreading the ripple effects on these commodity crops.

When food companies weigh whether to continue operating in Russia and other countries in the region, they will have to consider the human cost borne by people uninvolved in the conflict, such as the vulnerable communities in Egypt that rely on Russian and Ukrainian wheat for their (subsidized) daily bread. For sectors depending on these and other commodities, the supply disruptions are cascading down the value chain, creating volatility in price and supply for many products that might not seem to be immediately affected. In some cases, the effect on downstream industries may be dramatic as companies struggle with shortage-driven business-continuity risk and spikes in input costs well beyond anything they’ve planned for. The impacts downstream can also be hard to see when considering just the commodities. For example, palladium shortages could affect the production and costs of catalytic converters, hampering the auto industry. Companies across sectors—not just in energy and natural resources, but also in consumer goods, manufacturing, technology, retail, and logistics—should be running scenarios to prepare for uncertain outcomes. Macroeconomic factors In a fractured scenario, persistently high and frequently spiking commodity prices and deepening supply shortages will accelerate the inflation that was already underway before the war began. Consumers are likely to cut back on nonessential spending, depending on their sensitivity and exposure to price increases, and central banks will fall under greater pressure to raise interest rates. Even in a cautious scenario, elevated commodity prices will prevail. In a fractured scenario, persistently high and frequently spiking commodity prices and deepening supply shortages will accelerate the inflation that was already underway before the war began. Across all scenarios, financial markets are likely to see even greater volatility as investors react to developments in the war and affected economies. Capital flows to Eastern Europe will diminish, and in a fractured scenario, a liquidity crunch could escalate as investors exercise greater caution and respond to central bank moves. The combination of reduced consumer spending and deteriorating financial conditions leads to an economic slowdown or recession in extreme scenarios. US GDP contracted 1.4% in the first quarter, and while this isn’t wholly attributable to the war, it’s the clearest signpost yet of danger ahead for 43 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 the US economy. This could put governments back in the position of introducing economic stimulus measures, as they did during the Covid–19 pandemic—all while stubbornly high commodity prices could suppress any economic boost that would help consumers cope with recession. Policy and technology implications In a fractured scenario, sanctions and trade interruptions would realign geopolitical blocs, with trade and investments blocs decoupling. Europe and the US are already rekindling trade relationships with some regimes that had been out of favor, including Venezuela and Iran, in order to shore up crude oil inventory. In a cautious scenario, global trade resumes, but a premium would remain for domestic or secure supply lines. Governments are likely to implement more active industrial policies, along with interventions aimed at counteracting the harm from the conflict or to accelerate their response, particularly in nations that rely on resource imports from the conflict region. The European Union’s REPowerEU initiative, for example, aims to speed up and streamline the process for developing renewable energy infrastructure. In the private sector, investors and consumers are likely to further increase scrutiny on energy and supply chain issues across scenarios. Cybersecurity will receive added attention, especially in a fractured world, and the investments in protection and amelioration will increase. Windfall profits and the energy transition The crisis is likely to accelerate the energy transition, as markets race to increase their reliance on renewables as part of a broader strategy to reduce their dependence on Russian hydrocarbons. Green energy will increasingly be associated with localization of energy supply. The immediate increase in energy prices makes renewables more attractive. For example, green hydrogen may be more competitive in some markets, given higher gas prices. In the near term, however, high prices for some commodities (for example, nickel, palladium, and polysilicon) could blunt demand for renewables and energy storage. There will likely be a growing recognition of the inherent volatility of the energy transition, leading to a recognition that fossil fuels will be needed as bridge fuels (particularly natural gas, and even coal) and a potential renaissance of nuclear energy. The rise in energy prices will also deliver windfall profits to many fossil fuel energy companies far from the conflict. Executive teams will have to decide whether to reinvest these profits in producing more traditional fuels, invest them in new businesses focused on renewables, or distribute them to shareholders. Scrutiny from policymakers will increase the pressure to make visible, productive use of these windfalls. At the same time, energy security is likely to be more prominently linked to national security, with calls to redesign global supply chains and diversify away from hostile states. These shifts and the transition from fossil fuels will clearly result in higher prices for consumers, either directly or in the 44 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 form of taxes, at least over the medium term. It remains an open question how much consumers will be willing to bear, particularly in the context of underlying and accelerating inflation. Respond and reposition Responding to an unfolding crisis, ensuring the safety of employees, and protecting the continuity and resilience of operations has been the first order of business for companies affected by the war in Ukraine. The next task must be to reposition organizations to thrive in a changed environment. In approaching this, executives can use the same themes that have guided them through the uncertainty of the past few years. • Innovation. How can the company adapt and evolve to changed conditions? As with the ongoing energy transition and the Covid-19 pandemic, new technologies and ways of working may be critical assets in setting up new models. • Impact. How will supply disruptions impact the company’s ESG ambitions? Some emissionsreduction ambitions could see a setback in the immediate rush to substitute energy and commodity sources but could then accelerate as companies and countries invest in renewables to shore up energy security and more sustainable commodity supplies. • Economics. Identifying where to invest in strengthening resilience is critical in the short and medium term. But long-term viability demands that executives continue to focus on generating short- to mid-term value in order to draw the capital and access resources necessary for success. In the near term, executives can follow a simple, five-step approach for determining how to respond and begin to reposition (see Figure 4). 1. Identify how each of the three levels of disruption (commodity, macroeconomic, political and technological) affects your business operations. For example, companies should evaluate how the renewed focus on energy security might affect their own energy transition and how inflation could raise the costs of capital projects. 2. Quantify immediate effects of disruption and play out responses for each level of disruption. For example, companies should consider which alternative sources could come online to disrupt any benefits from a potential windfall. Testing the more extreme edge, they must also consider what commodity price would compel them to shut down operations, or when they might need to break contracts to find new vendors. 3. Respond with near-term actions and reposition for longer-term success. For example, companies should determine which capital projects in the queue they should accelerate to take advantage of a changed business environment. Companies also need to evaluate supply chain and stranded-asset risks and determine where they should invest in resilience (for more, read the Bain Brief “Managing Stranded Costs on the Long Road to Net Zero”). 45 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 4. Tailor scenarios and define signposts and leading indicators. Most executives will want to know how quickly they can get their business back to normal. Identifying the right indicators will help them determine whether they’re moving through a cautious or fractured scenario. That will shed light on what changing conditions they need to understand—for example, assessing what would happen if a competitor in China can access low-cost Russian oil while others have to pay more for nonsanctioned crude. 5.

Many organizations are struggling to balance acquiring talent needed to pursue new opportunities and retaining employees with the skills necessary to support legacy businesses. Bain’s recent research on inclusion found that about 80% of employees in oil and gas view inclusion as very important in their workplace, but the oil and gas sector lags other industries in fostering inclusion. Leaders can help with retention and integration across talent pools by clearly signaling their commitment to the energy transition, promoting growth for individuals, and facilitating connections among employee groups. Energy and natural resources companies will need to create an inclusive environment for new and diverse employees, while also valuing legacy talent. By Brenen Blair, Anders Bruhn, and Emily Emmett 49 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Navigating the energy transition will be a generational challenge, requiring top-tier talent to solve incredibly complex problems. Meeting this challenge will require retaining and reskilling today’s workers, while integrating new people with varied backgrounds and capabilities. Leaders will need to invest in creating inclusive organizations where everyone feels like a valued contributor with a shared purpose. Generations of talented individuals have pursued careers in energy because it offered opportunities for learning, teamwork, and impact in the service of powering our communities. This will be as true in the future as it was in the past. Looking backward, the talent that made the difference was concentrated in engineering and operational disciplines. But as the energy transition expands the range of business activities that energy companies pursue, that talent base is expanding and diversifying. Engineering proficiency is no less critical to success, but companies also need to integrate expertise in new areas such as product development, human-centered design, and regulatory affairs. “Working in energy gives me a sense of purpose. It makes me feel I’m working on something bigger than myself, something bigger than my company.” —Battery engineer, renewable energy, 33 Talent strategy is becoming an existential priority in the energy sector. This is the result of several pressures challenging the ability to find, hire, and retain talent: a wave of retiring professionals, demand for new roles to build out new businesses, and a talent drain from the energy sector to technology, to name a few. To address these gaps, companies are rethinking how and where to expand the funnel for potential new hires, while also innovating and experimenting with new strategies to retain and reskill the workforce that keeps their current businesses running. Power utilities, for example, will need new teams to build out wind farms and battery arrays, but will also continue to require teams that can keep thermal plants running. This isn’t the first time that the energy industry had to adapt its workforce to major changes in technology, regulation, and economics. Establishing the business models that built the modern energy landscape and building the infrastructure that delivers energy at a massive scale to power the global economy required a broad range of talent. In more recent decades, however, as many companies’ strategies focused on incremental growth and continuous improvement, the workforce evolved to be more geared to deliver operational excellence and prudent capital management, rather than building disruptive and innovative new businesses. In the decade ahead, both are priorities. As economies confront the need to reduce carbon emissions, the energy workforce is once again transforming. Energy companies must design employee value propositions that invite and appeal 50 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 to the new talent needed for new capabilities and businesses, without threatening or alienating their current workforce. “Multinational oil and gas companies are competing with every other big company out there for talent and need a real value proposition.” —Subsea engineer, oil and gas, 29 Winning new talent with diverse new perspectives Energy companies know they need to attract employees with new skills and capabilities, often from more diverse demographics than the current workforce. Some of this talent will need to be won over from the technology, finance, and public sectors, and they’ll bring new perspectives on teaming, compensation, and location (including remote options). Like current employees, they want to feel included in the companies they work for, and they want to know they’re experiencing an equitable talent journey, no matter their role. But in our interviews over the past year with the people that energy companies are trying to win over, many are skeptical of the motives of the industry, and doubtful of their ability to succeed in incumbent energy companies. Senior managers will need to find ways to reassure these new workers that they’re an essential part of the team, valued for their unique capabilities and perspectives. “I want it to be clear that green investments are not just a PR stunt . . . trust would be the No. 1 factor to determine if I am interested in a job or not.” —PhD student, organometallic chemistry, 29 However, in going for this new cohort, energy companies find themselves in a challenging starting position. In addition to weak representation of diverse talent, the industry lags on overall measures of inclusivity (see Figure 1). While most energy executives are aware of the talent crunch in their sectors and the obstacles preventing them from drawing in more diverse talent, they may be overlooking some important keys to success. Inclusivity is an important factor for career success in every sector, but especially in some energy and natural resources (ENR) industries. Bain’s recent research found that nearly four out of five employees in the US oil and gas sector rate inclusivity as very important in an employer, the most of any sector we surveyed. 51 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 “I want diversity in thinking, diversity in gender . . . more inclusion of people from different cultures and backgrounds is necessary for getting different ideas on the table.” —Undergraduate student, mechanical engineering, 22 However, Bain’s research also found that many senior leaders may have a rosier picture of inclusivity in their companies than the new hires they’re hoping will build their careers there (see Figure 2). Across factors, senior executives rated their organizations as more inclusive than did more junior team members. These blind spots make it harder for energy and natural resources companies to know how to make their organizations more inclusive to a more diverse pool of talent. They can make it hard to stem the “leaky bucket” effect, in which well-intentioned recruiting efforts bring in racially or genderdiverse employees—who then leave soon after because they don’t feel like they belong or are included. Figure 1: Oil and gas trails other industries in measures of inclusivity Note: Employees surveyed in Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States Source: Bain Inclusive Organization Survey, 2021 (n=9,494) Percentage of employees who feel fully included, by industry 0 10 20 30% Consumer products Financial services Professional services Retail Oil and gas Telecom Media Automotive Technology Industrials and manufacturing Healthcare 52 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 “My perception is that traditional energy companies right now are misaligned with what I believe.” —Associate engineer, renewable energy, 22 Bain’s recent research on inclusivity identified the factors that make ENR employees feel included. Top factors included growth opportunities, transparent feedback, a mindset for growth among leadership, and strong coaching and professional development rituals—things that would be important to anyone navigating a career path. People in underrepresented groups (including women, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and LGBTQ+) reported greater inclusion if they saw inclusion in the company’s diversity mission and goals and experienced it in team meetings, performance reviews, and team building. They also felt more included if they worked with leaders who had a growth mindset and a commitment to transparent feedback and were open to unique points of view. Supporting current talent While energy companies scrutinize and adapt talent strategies to include new sources and types of skills, it would be a mistake to assume that “legacy” talent profiles and preferences will remain unchanged. Most of the current energy workforce is highly motivated to support the energy Figure 2: Unconscious blind spots among senior leaders can limit their ability to design the right solutions for inclusivity Notes: Majority defined as straight, white, male; minority includes racial and sexual minorities; respondents were asked to rate each system on a scale of 1 to 7 Source: Bain Inclusive Organization Survey (n=9,494, ENR sector n=406) Extent to which respondents believe systems are inclusive in their organization 1 3 5 7 Recruiting Pay/bonus structure Formal mentorship Performance measurement Promotion opportunities Fully inclusive Not at all inclusive Majority, senior executives Minority, entry level 53 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 transition and eager to apply their current capabilities and new skills to new missions. They’re also keen to remain relevant and valuable in an uncertain future. “You wouldn’t want to be stuck in an industry that is potentially going to be gone in 20 years; you’re looking at building a 30- to 40-year career.” —Subsea engineer, oil and gas, 29 The energy sector needs a skilled workforce doing many of the same things that have kept the industry running for decades—and will remain important for years to come. Yet even established roles are changing. Leaders need to continually inspire and motivate the workforce, making sure skills don’t erode, and showing these workers they remain important, valued, and included, even as their companies are transformed. “How will the company help me transition my knowledge and experiences into something that could help the energy transition?” —Telecom engineer, oil and gas, 30 The inclusion imperative There’s no simple solution for the complex talent challenges facing the energy sector. Success will require companies to deeply engage with and draw out the full potential of new and current talent populations, and to inspire them to innovate and solve problems together, not just in parallel. We believe that improving the sense of inclusion for all employees, old and new, will be a critical enabler of the evolving talent engine required to power the energy transition. A sincere commitment to inclusion makes organizations both higher performing and more welcoming for all workers, across lines of capability, demographics, and tenure. Bain’s recent report on inclusion shows that employees who feel fully included are up to six times more likely to remain with their current employer, and are much more likely to promote their place of employment to others (+71 vs. –83, using Bain’s employee Net Promoter ScoreSM methodology of calculating the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors) than those who feel “not at all included.” New employees want to have a seat at the table—to be invited to help solve the challenge of how to serve their communities in more environmentally sustainable ways. Existing employees also want to contribute to new priorities and want to know their unique skills and experiences remain valuable in an uncertain future. Inclusion won’t solve all of the complex talent challenges, but it will play a foundational role in any strategy. 54 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Getting this right as an organization is complex in any scenario, even more so in an industry undergoing major disruption. The tactics that support and improve inclusion are nuanced. But we’ve found a few common themes across industries that feel especially relevant to today’s energy landscape. • Signal commitment. People working in energy, both new and existing employees, are looking to know that they’re a part of the solution; that their organization is committed to thoughtfully navigating the transition; and that their perspectives are valued. Leaders should listen deeply, then talk openly and frequently about a sincere commitment to both the transition and fully including a diverse talent base. “I want to see a clear roadmap to decarbonization and actual metrics to measure that . . . words without measurable metrics are not as convincing.” —Development engineer, renewable energy, 25 • Promote growth. Everyone wants to build skills to navigate to the other side. Everyone wants to look ahead to a rewarding career path, characterized by deeper skills and expanding autonomy and authority. Invest in building clear, transparent career paths for new talent and helping existing talent understand lateral opportunities. Cultivate a growth mindset in leaders and give decision-making authority and leadership opportunities to the next generation to help build skills and confidence. Recognize that making this successful will require a complex set of changes to both ingrained behaviors and standard talent operations. “I do think the scale up of energy technologies is going to require new skills that have to be learned and developed.” —Analytical scientist, renewable energy, 30 • Facilitate connection. Scrutinize the organizational silos that exist today, and guard against reinforcing them or creating new ones. New and existing employees need to be truly integrated, with an appreciation for the roles everyone plays in serving the organization’s long-term purpose and near-term strategy. Identify and experiment with tactics to strengthen connection across potential silos, for example, through Agile teaming, cross-training, mentoring programs, and diversity affinity groups. Navigating the energy transition will require the deliberate marriage of new and existing talent communities over many years, joining together to adopt new ways of working in support of new products and services as well as legacy business models. These are the building blocks of inclusion for a diverse population, which we see as essential to attracting, retaining, and benefiting from the full potential of the diverse talent base needed to thrive in the energy transition. 55 Energy and natural resources companies are building broad coalitions to develop policies that accelerate decarbonization. By Julian Critchlow, Aaron Denman, Dale Hardcastle, and Cate Hight Transition trends Creating a Coordinated Approach to Decarbonization At a Glance Companies have always needed to pay attention to stakeholders, but more sophistication is required now since the changes required by the energy transition touch many aspects of industry and society. Executives of ENR companies are focused on decarbonization but see the lack of clear and stable government policy as a major barrier to investment in new growth businesses and transformational change. A comprehensive decarbonization effort demands a coordinated approach. Coalitions of companies, government agencies, citizen groups, and other nongovernmental organizations can be catalysts to accelerate essential policy changes. 56 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Europe’s efforts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas have highlighted the issues of energy security and supply to a degree not seen in decades. For many, the impetus to decouple Europe’s energy demand from Russian supply creates a logical incentive to accelerate the energy transition. The European Union’s REPowerEU program, for example, includes a broad collection of measures, including diversifying the supply of natural gas, speeding up electrification of mobility, and improving the electrical system by removing bottlenecks in infrastructure. At the same time, others see the current moment as requiring a step back from the race to decarbonize, encouraging more fossil fuel development and use as a way of offsetting the lost supply of Russian oil and gas—lost, at least, to Western nations imposing sanctions. Some coal share prices rose as much as 400% in the first weeks of the war, as traders prepared for global demand to spike. Most of the energy executives that we speak with agree that the long-term direction is clear: We must continue to decarbonize and create a more sustainable, lower-carbon economy. Everyone seems to agree that’s where we want the world to go by 2050. But 2050 is long way off. The more imminent question is, “How do we navigate the transition in the next 5 to 10 years?” Delivering the energy transition is complex We’ve already come a long way. In most places, the cost of renewable energy is already competitive with fossil fuel power. With the precipitous fall in battery prices and longer lifetimes, electric vehicles (EVs) have reached lifetime cost parity in key markets. Executives are focused on decarbonization, but they see the lack of clear and stable government policy as a major barrier to transformational change. What’s more, energy executives tell us they’re eager to invest more (and more rapidly) in sustainable, lower-carbon assets. They’re under pressure from investors, customers, suppliers, employees (current and future) and a wide range of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) asking them to lead on climate change. Indeed, with more than $130 trillion of global capital now under management that has agreed to consider carbon in their investment decisions, these companies have little choice but to pursue a more sustainable future, if they want it funded. 57 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Executives are focused on decarbonization, but they see the lack of clear and stable government policy as a major barrier to transformational change. In the US, some policies have been enacted, like the 2021 infrastructure package that injected capital to speed up the transition—updating electric grids, adding EV charging stations, investing in green hydrogen and direct air carbon capture. But in general, a lack of comprehensive federal carbon policy dampens the private sector’s ability to invest with confidence in decarbonization; nearly half of executives in utilities, oil, and gas cite policy uncertainty as a reason for delaying investment (see Figure 1). A patchwork of state climate policies remedies this to some extent, but this fragmented landscape isn’t a reliable foundation for the long-term, capital-intensive change that’s required. Delivering the energy transition requires navigating a complex environment where many parties want to be involved in every decision. Consider the electrification of mobility. The European Union and some states in the US have set target dates to stop selling cars with internal-combustion engines, to speed up adoption of electric vehicles. But auto manufacturers can’t produce more EVs without enough batteries, and the battery makers can’t produce enough batteries without a much larger supply of lithium and more gigafactories to build them. Once the EVs are on the road, who will ensure there are enough charging stations in the right places? And as the charging stations appear, how will the grid be fortified to handle the transmission and distribution of far more electricity than the power utilities were expecting just a few years ago? The lack of coordination across this complex landscape Figure 1: Policy uncertainty is delaying investment in new businesses by oil and gas companies and utilities Source: Bain ENR Transition survey, 2022 (n=1,037, oil and gas n=297, utilities n=229) Percentage of executives delaying investments in new businesses due to uncertainty about policy Oil and gas 46% Utilities 49% 58 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 threatens the pace of change required for the energy and resource transition, which explains why it’s ever more important for companies to engage with stakeholders across the value chain. Stakeholders provide the catalyst Companies have always needed to pay attention to stakeholders, but more sophistication is required now. Setting clear targets and showing progress toward them will become more important. Getting this right will go a long way toward giving companies license to transform their business and launch new growth businesses. Getting it wrong can upend companies and risk the wrath of investors and the scorn of consumers. • Civil society. Greta Thunberg is just one person, but she represents millions of other young people in the “climate anxiety” generation. A study published in The Lancet last year reported that half of kids studied were worried about climate change, and nearly half said it had affected their daily life and functioning. They haven’t known a world where climate change wasn’t a major issue, and they’re skeptical of companies as part of the solution. Setting targets for reducing emissions is a step in the right direction, but few skeptics will be won over until companies start reporting significant emissions reductions aligned with Paris Agreement targets. • Investors. Vast portfolios and assets are being committed to climate goals. At COP26 last November, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero brought together more than $130 trillion of private capital to support reaching net zero by 2050. Investors want transparency and international standards to measure progress. Organizations like the Science-Based Targets initiative, CDP, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures are stepping in to fill those needs, supported by an ecosystem of software players. Private equity could play a large role. As public companies and banks move away from “gray” investment, private equity and smaller firms are gathering up these assets, which will continue to serve consumer demand for many years. • Customers. Corporate customers are making their own sustainability commitments, and they want greener supply chains—both fuels and material. Individual customers want greener goods and food products. But how much of a premium are they willing to pay? What are the equity implications? Coalitions that pool demand could speed up the development of green products and bring prices down. Groups like the First Movers Coalition, the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, and Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst Program could help make green technologies a better financial bet than gray assets. • Mineral and fuel suppliers. A growing focus on Scope 3 emissions is putting more pressure on these suppliers. Projects like Pathfinder and Horizon Zero are working to make the carbon embedded in products more visible, even as the US Securities and Exchange Commission considers which Scope 3 emissions are considered material in financial reporting. Commodities companies are trying to figure out how to improve existing operations while still providing the fuel and materials that the world’s economies need to keep running. Many are investing in second 59 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 engines of growth—including fuels, technologies, and projects like green hydrogen, direct air capture, and nature-based offsets—to strengthen their business across the energy transition. • Talent. Young workers, in particular, say they want to join firms with clearly articulated values, including commitments to reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate change. Three out of four US adults ages 18 to 34 expect their employers to take a stand on important issues including climate change, and 40% of millennials report taking a job because the company performed better on sustainability than alternatives. Policy takers to shapers Coalitions can be catalysts to accelerate the policy changes essential to the transition. We see companies bringing together stakeholders from many groups to send clear messages about climate policy. One international example is the Mission Possible Partnership, a coalition of corporations, investors, and customers focused on aligning supply chains and investment to decarbonize some of the world’s hardest-to-abate sectors, such as cement, steel, and chemicals. Coalitions can be catalysts to accelerate the policy changes essential to the transition. We see companies bringing together stakeholders from many groups to send clear messages about climate policy. In the US, coalitions are playing out at the state level. In Michigan, Consumers Energy formed a coalition with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar, and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan to settle a landmark integrated resource plan that would accelerate coal retirements from 2040 to 2025, enable net zero on the electric system by 2040, and save customers $600 million. Traditional government or corporate affairs approaches may not be enough to manage the complexity of the stakeholder landscape that has emerged around the energy and resource transition. Executives who are able to use coalitions as a catalyst to bring stakeholders together do a few things well: • Develop a full map of their stakeholder landscape and develop relationships with each key group. Treat stakeholders like customers. Develop personal relationships to understand stakeholders’ motivations and identify areas of common ground. • Engage early and often with policymakers at different levels to raise awareness about what the company is doing and ask for discrete support that can help accelerate it. Consider how a coalition-based approach might further these objectives. 60 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 • Recognize that, in many places, they’ll need to engage at both federal and state or province levels. Federalist countries often pilot new approaches at regional levels before the federal government adopts them. • Are transparent about where they’re spending on lobbying, to avoid any risk of appearing to say one thing while funding a conflicting objective. Corporations can’t plan effectively for the future without clear policy direction, and policy is a team sport. A comprehensive effort to decarbonize the energy and natural resources sectors demands a coordinated approach. Assembling coalitions of stakeholders is the surest way to develop policies and programs that are built to endure and less vulnerable to the winds of political change. 61 At a Glance Improving the circularity of plastics—returning used plastic to the supply chain rather than having it become waste—will be critical to meet sustainability goals. At the current pace, only 10% to 14% of plastics will be recycled by 2030, falling well short of announced targets. Companies that make and use plastics need to establish partnerships and change the way they operate to develop joint solutions that improve circularity. Supportive legislation and industry standards are also needed to help change behaviors and strengthen circular economics. Recycling rates are growing, but still far from where they need to go. By Sabine Atieh, Jayant Gotpagar, Peter Meijer, Harry Morrison, and Mark Porter Transition trends Improving Sustainability and Circularity in Plastics 62 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 As attention has focused on the problem of plastic pollution in the environment, governments and the private sector have taken steps to promote recycling and reduce plastic waste. These measures include phasing out certain single-use plastics and setting specific goals on plastics recycling. Targets vary by region. For example, the European Union aims to recycle all plastic packaging by 2030, whereas the US aims to recycle half. In the private sector, companies that make and use plastics are making new commitments to expand the use of recycled and bio-based plastics, reducing the amount of plastic used, and increasing recycling through better design and new investments in infrastructure. There are also many new recycling initiatives and partnerships, along with innovation in new plastic types such as low-carbon plastics made from biomaterials. Our clients tell us they understand that more needs to be done to improve the sustainability and circularity of plastic products, that is, the ability to put materials back into the supply chain rather than depositing them as waste. Plastics producers and users know that if concerns aren’t addressed, they risk facing more stringent regulation and more pressure from customers. But they’ve also said this is one of their many priorities, along with broader environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) commitments, including emissions reductions (see Figure 1). In many cases, improving plastic circularity will also reduce emissions, making it essential for delivering Figure 1: Petrochemical executives see circularity as a top ESG priority, more so than users of plastic Notes: Scope 1 measures greenhouse gases directly emitted by an organization or by activities under its control; Scope 2 measures indirect emissions from electricity or other power used by an organization; Scope 3 measures other indirect emissions related to an organization, including those resulting from the use of its products; ESG refers to environmental, social, and corporate governance Sources: Left chart, Bain Energy & Natural Resources survey, 2021 (n=175); right chart, Bain Circularity survey, 2021 (n=191) Plastic producers Plastic users Of the following, which are the 3 highest priority ESG topics for your company?

Circularity efforts fall short There’s a lot of activity underway on recycling and circularity, but it’s still not enough to provide the amount of recycled material that industry will need. Our recycling scenarios, based on current industry efforts and trajectories, suggest that by 2030, between 50 million and 70 million metric tons of plastics will be recycled annually, or 10% to 14% of total plastic consumption (see Figure 2), well below the targets set by companies and governments in, for example, the US and the EU. This misalignment between what companies want to buy and what will be available could inflate prices for recycled plastics, as competition heats up for the limited supply. Also, as the feedstock required for producing recycled plastics becomes bottlenecked, plastics producers will need to secure supplies to remain competitive as the market scales. These dynamics add to the uncertainty of the prospects for recycled plastics growth and will hinder investment. A shortage of recycled and renewable plastics could also permanently reduce demand for these products if users shift to alternatives to meet their recycling targets. This will be in addition to customer efforts to reduce the amount of plastics used, and the risk of cost increases for virgin plastics due to new Figure 2: The market for recycled plastic could grow significantly, but is likely to make up less than 15% of total plastics supply by 2030 Source: Bain & Company analysis Million metric tons of recycled plastic, global 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 Total plastics supply Recycled plastics (upper range) Recycled plastics (lower range) 2020 2030 2040 2050 6%–9% Recycled plastics as a share of total 10%–14% 14%–23% 17%–45% 64 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 taxes like the UK’s plastics tax or other extended producer responsibility measures. So it’s important for plastics producers to scale up their recycling efforts and develop solutions to meet their customers’ needs for sustainable and low-carbon solutions at scale. Faster industrialization of the recycling industry, better waste-sorting solutions, and more technical expertise, especially in chemical recycling, will all be needed. Accelerating plastics circularity As we talk with our clients, we’re seeing three types of actions aimed at accelerating the momentum behind plastics recycling. • Innovation and new technology • Partnerships and new business models • Legislation and standards Innovation and new technology. One reason that recycling rates are so low is that the technologies involved aren’t well-developed. Recycling rates are higher in categories where technology, infrastructure, and public and consumer engagement are more mature—for example, mechanical recycling for PET bottles in Europe, which is around 50%. Scaling up recycling also comes with challenges, though, as it gets increasingly difficult and costly to increase collection rates while also capturing smaller and less-efficient volumes of used plastic. In the private sector, companies that make and use plastics are making new commitments to expand the use of recycled and bio-based plastics, reducing the amount of plastic used, and increasing recycling through better design and new investments in infrastructure. Most plastic recycling today is mechanical—processing the material, but keeping the molecule intact. Chemical processing—changing the chemical structure of polymeric waste—can recycle more plastic. But chemical recycling remains mostly at R&D levels (1 kiloton or less) or pilot-program scale (10 to 30 kilotons), focused mostly on polyolefins. Pilots help overcome technical challenges, demonstrate scalability and commercial viability, and provide experience that improves process stability and yield. We expect some of these efforts to scale to commercial levels over the next five years. 65 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Advances in chemical recycling technologies targeting other plastics, such as polystyrene and PVC, are also gaining traction. Improving circularity for those plastics will be an important building block to boost overall plastics ESG performance and circularity across such end markets as electronics and automotive, where more companies are thinking about circularity. Recycling advances aren’t limited to technology, but also extend to collection, sorting, and processing to improve the quality of waste streams—a necessary step to boost recycling rates. Some companies are building up these capabilities. For example, before divesting the asset to PreZero Recycling, waste management company Suez (now Veolia) opened Europe’s most advanced facility for sorting used packaging in Germany. That plant can process 100 kilotons annually, using an innovative optical system to improve waste recovery. Another advancement under discussion is secondary material recovery facilities (MRFs), which aggregate residual waste streams from primary MRFs to pull out lower-value plastics and paper cartons more effectively. This misalignment between what companies want to buy and what will be available could inflate prices for recycled plastics, as competition heats up for the limited supply. Several material innovations have also been pushed by resin producers to improve circularity, which are now being adopted by plastic converters. These innovations include better-performing monomaterials, which improve the recyclability of the application, and lightweight polymers to help reduce packaging volume. Finally, low-carbon solutions are also developing quickly, with greater emphasis on producing chemicals from renewable sources. For example, Origin Materials focuses on improving production of plant-based building blocks for PET as a negative-carbon solution to replace fossil-based PET. Partnerships and new business models. Scale, sustainable solutions will require partnerships that ensure a steady supply of renewable materials and a market for recycled material. Supply chain partnerships can help ensure a consistent flow of renewable inputs, which is essential to develop a market. These partnerships need to extend beyond the local initiatives that have emerged in some regions. Plastics users are also forming partnerships. Mondelez International is working with waste management start-up Plastic Energy to use its polypropylene feedstock made from postconsumer plastics for Philadelphia Cream Cheese containers. Offtake agreements are critical to ensure demand for recycled materials as production scales up. These agreements, which ensure delivery of the recycled materials produced, give producers a runway to gain experience, become more efficient, and reduce costs. We typically find that early offtake 66 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 agreements are with customers willing to pay a premium for better ESG performance, whether because of individual commitments or local regulation. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company, Nestlé, and PepsiCo have made commitments to increasing recycled content in plastic bottles. Our customer research has found that brands are typically willing to pay initial premiums of up to 25% above virgin pricing for these applications. Depending on the application, the relative change in product price will be much lower as the plastic forms only a small part of the total cost. In plastic resins for bottles, for example, a premium of around 20% for recycled plastics raises the price of the end product by about 2%. A Bain survey across the UK, France, and the Netherlands found that 75% of consumers said they’d pay more for sustainable products. Legislation and standards. Plastic producers, recyclers, and consumers will need to work together to build support for change. They’ll need to develop better policies for collecting and managing plastic waste, supported by better consumer education and behavior on waste sorting. They’ll need to encourage investments and funding for new technologies, for example, through the OECD’s Extended Producer Responsibility project. They’ll need to agree on taxonomy as well as standards, for example, around using a mass balance approach or segregated supply chains for virgin and recycled plastics. Governments can also take specific actions to support growth in recycling. For example, they could restrict the use of, or tax, virgin plastics, thus promoting the use of recycled content. They could also consider minimum requirements of recycled content in plastics by extending renewable blending requirements to chemicals, similar to renewable fuel standards, which will help promote the use of renewable hydrocarbons in petrochemicals. The outcome, with internationally binding commitments, could be an important step in creating a global environment with investments channeled toward building up recycling infrastructure. Support is also developing around the world. In March 2022, the UN agreed to develop a treaty designed to end plastic pollution. Details are still to be ironed out, but the specific resolution is likely to address the full life cycle of plastic, including production, design, and disposal. The outcome, with internationally binding commitments, could be an important step in creating a global environment with investments channeled toward building up recycling infrastructure. Companies and associations, such as the International Council of Chemical Associations, have endorsed the treaty as an important step to address plastic pollution. 67 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 • • • Although current efforts aren’t yet at the scale required, plastics recycling, the use of recycled content, and the use of low-carbon plastics are sure to increase. Companies that prepare now to scale up, connect to high-quality waste streams, and ensure a long-term supply of feedstock can put themselves in a stronger position in sustainable plastics.

By Steve McGrath, Brian Murphy, Dunigan O’Keeffe, and Neelam Phadke Strategic capabilities How to Do Engine 2 At a Glance Energy and natural resources companies are ramping up spending in new growth businesses to complement or replace their core. Success depends on mission clarity, a bold vision that pragmatically lays out the objective. Model clarity is essential, too, defining how a new entrepreneurial venture can thrive alongside the legacy business. 71 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Few sectors have ever had to change as quickly and completely as the energy and natural resources (ENR) sectors are changing now. Executives know they need to develop new growth businesses that are in some cases very different from their core. Most have already moved past talk: We found that ENR companies increased the capital allocated to growing new businesses by about 50%, on average, from 2020 to 2022—a huge jump. Senior leaders expect to see results quickly from such a large investment: 72% told us they expect to move these investments to scale by 2030—not far away. Executives know they need to develop new growth businesses that are in some cases very different from their core. Most have already moved past talk: We found that ENR companies increased the capital allocated to growing new businesses. Challenge acknowledged, goals set, capital allocated. Now comes the hard part. How do they grow these new businesses, which we call Engine 2? What are the preconditions for executing successfully? Essential clarity on mission and model For most ENR sectors, there’s a limited set of promising growth opportunities that make good use of the incumbents’ capabilities and offer a compelling story for investors. As a result, many ENR companies are pursuing the same Engine 2 growth areas. They can’t all win in the same space. It’s OK to have an Engine 2 mission that overlaps with others’, but it’s not OK to lack clarity on what your mission is. Mission clarity. Mission clarity starts with a bold objective. No one gains a leading position in a new profit pool by dipping their toe in the water. Still, the mission needs to be pragmatic and strike a balance between being bold enough to change the world’s energy infrastructure, while not spending capital imprudently. Mission clarity is also not as simple as just choosing green hydrogen, sustainable agriculture, or carbon offsets. The mission must include a clear sense of which customer needs you’re addressing, whether you have the capabilities to achieve it, or whether you’ll need to find those through M&A and partnerships. 72 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Model clarity. Traditional energy and resource companies, the incumbents, usually move at a slower pace than their start-up competitors. That’s part legacy infrastructure and operations, and part company culture. Successful Engine 2 efforts play by a different set of rules. They find ways to operate in a middle zone, taking advantage of all the benefits of a large company (access to capital, deep experience, large networks of suppliers and customers) while steering clear of the drawbacks (excessive caution, bureaucratic bottlenecks, a wait-and-see attitude). To make this happen, Engine 2 initiatives need to design for growth from the start. One of the elements we see ENR incumbents struggle with most is what we call the Founder’s Mentality�. This means setting up a team that can act like insurgents, not incumbents, and clearing the way so that they can do that. Successful Engine 2 efforts play by a different set of rules. They find ways to operate in a middle zone, taking advantage of all the benefits of a large company while steering clear of the drawbacks. Some companies have found ways to launch Engine 2s where mission and model clarity work well together. For example, Italian energy provider Enel set a bold vision to replace its core business. It approached several new markets with a mindset of “why not us?” and found customers as it developed its Engine 2 capabilities in hydroelectric, onshore wind, and solar power. Enel’s leadership combined all its renewable assets into one business unit, along with the people who knew them best. That allowed Enel Green Power to start with a sizable base of about $1 billion in earnings, going from 4.5 gigawatts of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 50 gigawatts by 2021. The company has maintained its bold ambition and plans to dedicate 43% of capex to affordable and clean energy, adding 105 gigawatts of renewables capacity by 2030. In another example, Australian iron ore producer Fortescue has set out to become a leading player in green hydrogen, aiming to produce 15 million tons by 2030. Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), a distinct entity in the company, is building collaborative relationships around new hydrogen projects, including an electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Queensland, Australia, which will provide green hydrogen to power a manufacturing hub. FFI moves rapidly while benefiting from the parent company’s cash flow and relationships. 73 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Building mission and model clarity Among the companies that we see successfully executing Engine 2 strategies, mission and model clarity lead to better decision making on a range of factors that influence success (see Figure 1). Many great ENR companies started out as insurgents. All great ENR companies have had to evolve with cycles and technology. The successful ones grew large and evolved their operating models to manage scale operations that often span the globe and a wide range of businesses. Developing Engine 2 initiatives offers incumbents the chance to ignite an entrepreneurial spirit in their DNA, in order to develop new growth businesses that will lead them to thrive in the energy transition.

By Francesco Cigala, Pete Guarraia, Andrew Welch, and Jeff Wen Strategic capabilities Managing Operations through Disruptions At a Glance Chief operating officers have never been more vital to corporate strategy—and never more visible. Supply chain disruptions, including those driven by the pandemic, inflation, semiconductor shortages, and war in Ukraine, have put operations in the headlines and made the COO’s role integral to corporate strategy. As companies pledge to reach net zero, operations teams are balancing their traditional imperatives of delivering products and services with the need to decarbonize and meet investors’ expectations about sustainability. 75 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 The role of the chief operations officer has always been essential, but for many years it was a low-profile role, charged with safely producing and delivering product on time and at a reasonable cost. That’s changed quickly. Over the past few years, the responsibilities and measures of success for COOs and their global operations have expanded significantly (see Figure 1). The COO’s role has become dramatically more complex as a series of global disruptions have made the role of operations chief more visible and more essential to corporate strategy. These disruptions include Covid-19, the war in Ukraine, trade conflicts, semiconductor shortages, and inflation of commodity prices. But among operations chiefs in the energy and natural resources sectors, the most enduring and significant disruption is the energy transition and the accompanying drive to make companies and their operations more sustainable. Every day, we talk with COOs who are working to balance their traditional imperatives of delivering products and services reliably and at a price that customers can afford, along with the need to decarbonize and meet investors’ expectations about sustainability. The high profile of these trends and disruptions, along with their influence on the availability of consumer and business goods, means that the role of operations can no longer be taken for granted. One indicator of this is the prominence of operations topics in the media. For example, over the past two years, the number of times “supply chain” was mentioned during corporate earnings calls more Figure 1: The COO’s job has become much more complex Source: Bain & Company Old priorities New priorities Ensuring diversity and equitability in suppliers Managing cost Reducing cost Supporting portfolio expansion Supporting portfolio expansion Establishing resilience Operating sustainably Monitoring the entire supply chain Adapt to shifting trade routes Competing for labor Create a digitalization agenda Mitigating supply chain effects of war in Ukraine Reducing inventory 76 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 than doubled, highlighting investors’ recognition of the criticality of operations. Supply chains and other operations are news. All of this raises the stakes for the COO and reduces the margin of error. The smallest of missteps can create disruptions that can leave business customers without the inputs they need to run their operations, and customers staring at empty shelves. Every day, we talk with COOs who are working to balance their traditional imperatives of delivering products and services reliably at affordable prices, along with the need to decarbonize and meet investors’ expectations about sustainability. But these shifts also mean that operations can become an even more powerful competitive tool. Being a low-carbon provider, for example, can become a competitive advantage when it enables companies to charge a premium for greener products. It can also provide other benefits to buyers. When a supplier reduces its carbon footprint, its buyers can reap the benefits as they tally the upstream, Scope 3 emissions of their own production. That can become a key benefit in sales discussions, just as the lack of progress on emissions reduction or other environmental, social, and corporate governance factors can become a barrier. Increasingly, suppliers won’t make it past the RFP process unless they can attest to their own progress on issues like diversity, transparency, and emissions reductions. How COOs are responding COOs are doing several things to successfully navigate this changing landscape. First, many of our COO clients tell us they’re more closely involved with setting corporate strategy than they were just a few years ago. This gives them a seat at the table and a voice in organizational decisions, including setting priorities, weighing financial trade-offs, and managing internal and external communications. This enables them to convey the possible effects on the supply chain and other operations of certain decisions before they’re made. More important, the COO is increasingly in a position to determine how quickly the company can adapt to disruptions, and also help set strategic direction that can allow the company to make the most of external conditions. Closely related, they’re building up the capabilities they need to support effective strategic planning. Data has always been an important tool in operations, but many operations teams are doubling down on advanced analytics, which help them develop a wider range of more specific scenarios—essential for planning under uncertainty. 77 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 The COOs we talk with are also laser-focused on improving the resilience of their supply chains. In the short term, they’re assessing the risks from immediate crises like the war in Ukraine, commodities inflation, and ongoing shortages due to Covid. Getting a handle on the primary risks, based on real data rather than conjecture, allows them to create realistic scenarios so they can react quickly when they see signposts indicating where conditions are headed. This is a challenging balancing act right now. Operations teams may need to invest more to ensure a reliable supply of inputs while at the same time finding themselves under pressure to manage costs tightly against the headwinds of inflation. There’s no simple answer, and each situation requires thoughtful analysis and careful decision making. Operations teams may need to invest more to ensure a reliable supply of inputs while also under pressure to manage costs tightly against the headwinds of inflation. Over the longer term, ops chiefs are building resilience with a larger suite of tools, such as redesigning products and processes, finding backup and alternative sources, building capacity buffers, and continually improving logistics. A key part of resilience is just acknowledging that disruptions are happening faster and more frequently, so adaption and recovery are capabilities that need to be developed and refined. Black swan events aren’t quite as rare as they once were. 78 Companies are building dynamic pricing capabilities as they come to terms with the persistence of volatility and inflation. By Jens Friis Hjortegaard, Emily Kasavana, Nimit Mehta, and David Schottland Strategic capabilities Pricing for Inflation in Energy and Natural Resources At a Glance Many executives at energy and natural resources companies thought inflation would be short-lived and that their positions on the value chain would protect them from increases. But inflation has persisted and looks likely to continue, along with pricing volatility. Companies need to adjust their pricing policies. The current crisis could spur companies to build up dynamic pricing capabilities that adapt to inflation spikes and prevent margin leakage. Carefully evaluating the profitability of customers and products, effectively enforcing contract terms, and centralizing pricing decisions are just some of the ways companies are responding. 79 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 No company is immune. After years of low volatility and stable inflation rates, energy and natural resources (ENR) companies have faced a steady stream of disruption: Covid-19 and its bounce back, unpredictable events like the Texas electricity blackouts or the container ship Ever Given blocking the Suez Canal, and now the war in Ukraine, which will reverberate in commodity markets for a long time. Pair these disruptions with broad, continuing inflation, worker shortages, and rising labor costs, and it isn’t news that many companies are struggling to recoup cost increases, leading to flat or even declining margins even as they post record top-line results and sell out their products (see Figure 1). Seeing the blind spots Until recently, many executives have heralded two prevailing responses to this environment that, when taken together, create a blind spot for ENR companies and their approach to pricing. “This is temporary and will soon pass.” Over the past year or two, many executives have taken the stance that they just need to get through the next three or four months, until business as usual returns. However, if history is a guide, while inflation spikes may resolve after a couple of years, possibly tempered by recession, volatility is likely to persist. Consider chemicals. Coming out of the 2008 financial crisis, price volatility continued for nearly seven years before the sector stabilized Figure 1: Margin growth hasn’t kept up with revenue growth for 63% of energy and resources companies Notes: Data includes top 125 companies in the ENR sector; a few companies that are private or not reporting data have been excluded Source: Refinitiv Share of companies with revenue growth higher than margin growth (H1 2021–H2 2021) Total ENR 63% 37% 103 Oil and gas 20 Power and utilities 23 Chemicals 22 Metals and mining 19 Agribusiness 19 0 20 40 60 80 100% Number of companies Margins outgrew revenue Revenue outgrew margins 80 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 (see Figure 2). The reality is beginning to sink in for many executives: This may be more than a temporary phenomenon. “We’re structurally protected from this.” Many ENR companies feel that their positions near the beginning of their value chains protects them from cost pressures. Even when the cost of inputs rises, they can usually make up margins in their sales. But this focus on raw inputs overlooks the other costs of doing business, which are also rising. Shipping costs have doubled since March 2021, and labor costs in the US were up 4.5% in the fiscal year ended March 2022, an increase from 2.6% the previous year (see Figure 3). Amid all this turbulence, executive teams have been applying the same pricing playbooks, policies, and approaches that they used before this upheaval. Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising; prolonged inflation like this hasn’t reared its head since the 1970s. Most corporate leaders haven’t had to deal with macroinflation during their careers, leaving them unsure of how to proceed. One thing is becoming clear, though: What worked before, no longer works as well. Dynamic pricing will become more important. Frequency of increases, decision rights, rigor of cost forecasts, back-order and freight policies, contract terms and conditions—everything is on the table as executive teams grapple with how best to protect margins without upsetting customers. Figure 2: In 2021, pricing was more variable than in any year since 2008 Source: Federal Reserve Economic Research Industrial Chemicals Producer Price Index (indexed to 100 in 1982) Annual standard deviation 0 10 20 30 100 200 300 400 0 2000 05 10 15 20 21 Steady price increase 2008 Higher price variance Lower price variance Higher price Price stability variance Standard deviations Price index 81 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 The crisis as catalyst Over the past year, executives have been trying out a range of actions to redefine their approach to pricing. Volatility and inflation may be the forcing mechanism of the moment. But by building pricing capabilities that allow them to react and adjust quickly, they’re positioning their companies for long-term success. • Recognize not all customers are the same. As economics change, so does the profitability of products and customers. In a volatile environment, companies need to understand those changes and take action. Some products cost more to deliver, and those increases need to be passed along. We’ve seen more companies willing to walk away from low-value customers, especially when capacity is constrained—although sales teams shouldn’t bear the brunt of this approach. At one power grid hardware company, a review showed where inflation was creating a gap between “sold” profitability and “delivered” profitability on many projects. By adjusting contracts and pricing to account for this, the company ensured they were capturing the value they intended. • Exchange price for other valuable features. As prices increase, some companies are offering other incentives to customers, like volume guarantees, exclusivity periods, or better service. When prices rose at one agrichemicals company, it began offering price hedging to customers. Developing Figure 3: Companies face a perfect storm of rising costs for transportation, labor, energy, and raw inputs Notes: The International Monetary Fund’s Energy Price Index includes crude oil, natural gas, coal, and propane indices; Commodities Price Index includes both fuel and nonfuel price indexes; compensation includes wages, salaries, and benefits Sources: US Bureau of Labor Statistics; IMF; Freightos Change in transportation, energy, and commodities prices (indexed to 100 in January 2019) Change in compensation 5% 2% 0 250 450 650 100 Change in BLS Employment Cost Index Freightos Baltic Index IMF Energy Price Index IMF Commodities Price Index 2019 20 21 22 116% 70% 137% 1.9 pp Change (March 2021– March 2022) 82 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 the capabilities to manage the hedging actually made pricing more predictable for customers and created a new revenue stream that helped stem a margin leak. • Enforce what’s already in the contract. Price increase contingencies in contracts are of little value if companies don’t enforce them. Many are now going back to review those terms, estimating the value of enforcing them, and equipping their commercial teams with the right data and scripts to have these difficult conversations with confidence. One company found it had simply misapplied indexes on one contract, leading to more than $10 million of missed revenue over several years. • Consider indirect increases. In addition to price increases tied to inflation indexes, companies are getting more comfortable adding surcharges for fuel, expedited shipping, inventory holding, and longer payment terms. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) are also playing a meaningful role in recovering cost increases in recent months. Some are tightening up on special exceptions, like small or rush orders, that create margin leaks. The average industrial company loses over 6% of revenue through off-invoice discounts and leakage, according to a global sample analyzed by Bain and PricefxPlasmaTM. • Adjust the product mix. During a period of inflation and supply shocks, deciding what to sell can be even more important than deciding whom to sell to. It’s critical to have a view of profitability by SKU, as well as by customer. One power producer has reacted to volatile costs by selling different types of power packages, while also rethinking the mix of its power-generating assets. Just as firing bad customers makes sense, so does shifting away from marginally profitable products. • Centralize pricing decisions. Companies often push pricing decisions close to the customer, but in volatile or inflationary times, centralized decisions can make more sense. Individuals and sales teams can’t always make decisions that reflect companywide constraints and options. Data on cost increases may not show up in sales tools. We’re seeing companies organize global pricing programs that are far more directive to regional or business unit champions, to ensure that inflation costs are addressed. No one can be certain, but history suggests that inflation bouts typically last about 30 months. However, the cure is often a recession, so volatility may persist even as prices level off. There are also plenty of signs to suggest structurally long-term inflation, including an aging workforce, investment costs of the energy transition, and repatriation of supply chains. Even after the high-single-digit inflation numbers are reined in, we may return to higher base levels than in the 2010s. In any case, the various potential outcomes all lead to the same takeaway: Companies that acknowledge the persistence of volatility and rewrite their pricing playbooks are more likely to maximize price realization, expand margins, and take advantage of pricing as a competitive weapon. 83 Many energy and natural resources companies are turning to acquisitions to rebalance their carbon portfolio and to green their operations. By Whit Keuer, Hyukjin Lee, and Arnaud Leroi Strategic capabilities M&A Opportunities in the Energy Transition At a Glance Despite low deal activity in 2021, more companies are turning to M&A to acquire lower-carbon assets, particularly in renewable power generation. Energy transition deals accounted for about 20% of all energy-sector deals greater than $1 billion in 2021. More companies are using deals to green existing operations and strengthen ESG assets; build green energy hubs and an integrated value chain to assist the energy transition; reshape business models; and invest in start-ups to acquire disruptive technology. 84 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 M&A activity in the energy and natural resources industry remained sluggish in 2021, rebounding only around 20% from 2020 and not yet recovering to prepandemic levels. Partly, this was the result of companies looking for demand to stabilize. Then, as stabilization largely took place, a second factor came into play: Companies began sharpening their capital discipline, which slowed dealmaking as fewer deals met their higher hurdle rates. We believe that conditions are primed for an upswing propelled by a resurgence in industry consolidation and portfolio management. The oil and gas industry is still highly fragmented in many sectors, and multiples remain depressed, setting the stage for consolidation to unlock new levels of efficiency. The conflict in Ukraine adds more complexity to the market, with many companies actively reviewing their portfolio and some exiting their Russian positions as BP has done. The oil and gas industry is still highly fragmented in many sectors, and multiples remain depressed, setting the stage for consolidation to unlock new levels of efficiency. Meanwhile, there will be growing opportunities for portfolio management across energy and natural resources, especially in chemicals. Over the years, companies have expanded their portfolios to the point that there’s now a lack of natural synergies among assets and a high degree of complexity. Above all, though, companies will turn to M&A to make more progress on the monumental journey of moving the world closer to a lower-carbon, sustainable future while also keeping their current businesses running. Many large companies have already pursued deals that accelerate their participation in the energy transition that, at its heart, requires all companies to reinvent themselves. In 2021, energy transition deals accounted for about 20% of all energy-sector deals greater than $1 billion (see Figure 1). The energy and natural resources industry’s reliance on M&A in 2022 to deliver the energy transition will play out across seven themes. Greening existing operations and strengthening environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) assets. Companies are aggressively making deals aimed at reducing carbon production from their operations to meet net-zero targets. For example, Occidental Petroleum, one of the top producers in the US’s Permian Basin, is acquiring solar generation assets to power its drilling and completions operations. At the same time, Suncor is partnering with other oil sands producers while investing to commercialize carbon-capture technology. 85 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Building green energy hubs. Deals are also fueling companies’ efforts to move beyond greening their existing operations and toward fundamentally changing their inputs, production processes, or products. BP and Equinor’s strategic partnership, Northern Endurance Partnership, was formed together with Eni, National Grid, Shell, and Total to create a refinery of the future that will act as a green energy hub within an industrial cluster. It will maintain integrated sourcing and production of renewable energy, with new feedstock streams and lower greenhouse gas fuels and products. Repositioning portfolios toward the energy transition. Companies are using M&A to accelerate shifts in their portfolios. This involves both divestments of high-carbon assets as well as investments in the energy transition. An example is Shell, which sold acreage in the Permian Basin to ConocoPhillips for $9.5 billion, in a move to help accelerate the company’s portfolio shift driven by the energy transition. Another example is LyondellBasell’s joint venture with Suez (now Veolia) and acquisition of European plastics-recycling company Quality Circular Polymers to mechanically convert consumer waste into 25,000 tons of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene per year. Utilities have been acquiring more renewable assets, and at higher multiples than we’ve seen for traditional gas-powered assets. Some utilities also are seizing opportunities in smart grid technologies and distributed storage, such as Southern’s 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure, a provider of smart grid services. Private equity firms play a big role in this shift to green operations by buying energy companies’ traditional high-carbon assets. Figure 1: Energy transition theses accounted for about 20% of large deals in the energy industry in 2021 Source: Dealogic 2021 energy deals with deal value greater than $1 billion Energy transition thesis Energy transition thesis Other energy deals Other energy deals Deal value 20 0 40 60 80 $484B 100% 141 Deal count 86 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 Establishing a critical position on the value chain to deliver energy transition products and services. BP made a move in this direction when it acquired the UK’s largest electric vehicle-charging company, which at the time operated more than 6,500 charging ports. Using M&A to reshape business models. Some companies have found that fully monetizing energy transition assets requires them to buy new capabilities for transformed business models. For example, Shell has a license to sell power to industrial customers in the UK electricity sector. Carving out new growth businesses. More companies are carving out, or “ring-fencing,” assets that take advantage of the energy transition opportunities. For example, LG Energy Solution, which LG Chem spun out as a separate entity in 2020, raised $10.7 billion to reach a valuation of $98 billion in a January 2022 IPO on enthusiasm for its EV battery business, a move that allowed the new subsidiary to trade at a multiple about eight times greater than its parent. The sector did something like this 10 to 15 years ago, when many companies put their infrastructure assets into master limited partnerships (MLPs), a trend that raised valuations across the board. Managing new growth businesses in this way can attract a new class of investors that are targeting this asset class in expectation of higher multiples than for the legacy business. Making strategic investments in start-ups to acquire disruptive technology. Finally, more companies will make early-stage investments in, or partner with, young companies that can help them become disrupters themselves. That’s the goal of a large petrochemical company’s investment in a blockchain company, or BASF’s corporate venture capital investment in LanzaTech, a carbon-recycling company. Above all, though, companies will turn to M&A to make more progress on the monumental journey of moving the world closer to a lower-carbon, sustainable future while also keeping their current businesses running. How winning companies do it In their effort to rely on deals to deliver the energy transition, some companies will emerge as leaders. Here’s how M&A practitioners in energy and natural resources can boost the odds of success. Take an activist approach to portfolio management. As portfolios change and become more diverse, companies need to undertake more frequent asset reviews to manage their business through this change. This review is critical in ensuring that the existing business continues to 87 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 meet current goals and would clear the same hurdles for investment today. Leaders need to be prepared to either invest in improvement or divest those areas where performance is falling short of what’s needed for today’s corporate strategy. Set a capital allocation strategy that’s tied to the corporate strategy, and lean toward the energy transition. That means recognizing that investments should target mature solutions like renewables, as well as less mature and more innovative solutions. It also means being disciplined about exploring profitable growth options in low carbon along multiple growth horizons. Incorporate ESG considerations into due diligence. Buyers need to actively understand and assess the relative performance of the target across critical ESG dimensions. This benchmarking exercise allows companies not only to understand the target’s true value, but also anticipate any costs associated with bringing the target in line with the buyer’s ESG strategy. This needs to feed into value creation planning and integration in order to unlock the full potential of the combination (for more, see the Bain Brief “The ESG Imperative in M&A”). Evolve the joint venture playbook to accelerate an energy transition strategy. This is a historic area of strength for many energy and natural resources companies as they’ve used joint ventures to partner in the development of oil and gas fields or large petrochemical complexes, often with state-owned enterprises. In addition to these traditional uses of joint ventures, companies increasingly are favoring joint ventures to accelerate energy transition strategies and combine expertise along the value chain, as it’s difficult for one company to have all the capabilities required. For example, there are several joint ventures globally related to the chemical recycling of plastic waste. These joint ventures involve three parties: traditional waste companies with expertise in the collection and preparation of waste and recyclable materials, a company with proprietary mechanical or chemical recycling technology, and a traditional chemical company with experience in processing and operating hydrocarbon and chemical plants (for more, see the Bain Brief “Delivering Results in Joint Ventures and Alliances Requires a New Playbook”). Fluid M&A market dynamics will provide myriad opportunities for resilient companies to transform their portfolios and reposition themselves for the great energy transition. The best companies view the industry’s era of complex uncertainties and unprecedented change for what it is: a time of historic possibilities. 88 Goals are set and targets have been announced. The next stages of the energy and resource transition depend on being bold and realistic. By Cate Hight, Torsten Lichtenau, Brian Murphy, and Nitesh Prakash Strategic capabilities Deliver Decarbonization with Visionary Pragmatism At a Glance Having set aggressive decarbonization targets, companies across sectors now face the challenge of executing at pace during a time of unprecedented turbulence. Many companies in the energy and natural resources sectors have been working toward these goals for many years, with varying degrees of success. Indicating the difficulty of achieving those ambitions, 31% of ENR companies missed Scope 1 and 2 targets they set for 2020. Companies that make the most progress will stay focused on their visionary net-zero ambition while showing ruthless pragmatism in delivering strategically. 89 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 If the year 2021 was about setting ambitions, 2022 is about coming to grips with how challenging the energy and resource transition is likely to be. Over the past two years, the number of companies establishing science-based targets for reducing their carbon emissions accelerated dramatically, as many prepared for the COP26 climate change conference last November (see Figure 1). But for companies in energy and natural resources (ENR), decarbonization is hardly new. Decarbonization and sustainability have been high on their agenda for several years because these industries are among the highest and most visible of carbon emitters, and because they’re under intense scrutiny to decarbonize. As an indication of how difficult it is to turn ambition into reality, consider that 31% of companies missed the Scope 1 and 2 targets they set for 2020, even though these emissions are the most controllable, and addressing them often makes good economic sense (see Figure 2). For many ENR companies, most emissions are downstream Scope 3, when customers use their product. None of this is happening in a green vacuum. Executives are trying to pursue their decarbonization targets during a period of turbulence that has created historic levels of uncertainty. They’re learning Figure 1: The number of companies pursuing science-based decarbonization targets has nearly quadrupled since 2020 Note: The COP26 UN climate change conference took place in Edinburgh, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12, 2021 Sources: CDP; Science Based Targets initiative; Bain analysis Number of companies with SBTi commitments or targets set 2018 19 20 21 22 (Jan–Apr) 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 147 366 775 2,166 57% 24% 19% 2,843 x2.8 Americas Asia-Pacific Europe, Middle East, and Africa COP26 jump 90 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 how to make an orderly carbon transition amid an unsettling geopolitical atmosphere, chronic supply chain disruptions, and rampant inflation. Progress in the next stages of the transition will depend on visionary pragmatism. Our clients are experimenting with more flexible and nimble approaches that will help them work through the many disruptions. Here’s a short list of some effective strategies. 1. Put a premium on strategic adaptability. Companies don’t need more climate scenarios, just clarity on the relevant ones. They need to identify the signposts that show the direction of travel, especially regulations and advances on the technology experience curve. We’re seeing companies adopt a more adaptable approach to strategy. For example, instead of setting five-year strategic plans with yearly refreshes, strategy becomes a more continuous activity, taking account of delivery commitments and the development agenda. Continuously assessing the signposts can guide ongoing and quarterly discussions within the executive team and the board as part of a living strategy. 2. Proactively address investor dissonance. Investors and lenders are raising their expectations about decarbonization. Among utilities investors, for example, 13% say they already have carbon targets or limits that guide investment decisions, and another 16% say they’re considering it. Figure 2: About one-third of ENR companies said they missed their Scope 1 and 2 targets in 2020 Notes: ENR includes agricultural commodities, chemicals, coal, electric utilities, metals and mining, and oil and gas; Scope 1 measures greenhouse gases directly emitted by an organization or by activities under its control; Scope 2 measures indirect emissions from electricity or other power used by an organization Sources: CDP 2017–2020 data (n=67); Bain & Company Energy and natural resources companies’ results for Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions 22% Missed by a lot (achieved less than 80% of target) Missed slightly (80%–100%) 69% Overachieved (100% or more) 9% 91 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 At the same time, they often aren’t willing to compromise on near-term returns. This creates dissonance in capital markets, as companies balance the trade-offs between their green ambitions on the one hand, and their growth and financial aspirations on the other. Capital market days for many companies have become longer, but not necessarily clearer. Executives need to strengthen the investor dialogue. That means focusing on strategic clarity, with specific near-term plans for decarbonization and longer-term pathways to net zero. For many energy and resources companies, it also means showing plans for new growth, including Engine 2 initiatives (for more, see Chapter 2, “Investing in New Growth Businesses”). Both efforts should make the business more valuable. Companies need to demonstrate progress in everything from Scope 1 and 2 decarbonization to customer collaboration on green products and meaningful investments in new growth. 3. Decarbonize “customer-back.” Customer preferences deeply influence the level of emissions generated during production and in the supply chain. Through procurement decisions, customers can have as much control over their upstream Scope 3 emissions as they do over Scope 1 and 2 activities. Leaders will set targets for all three levels. Downstream Scope 3 emissions also provide new opportunities, even though ENR companies sometimes view them with trepidation. Visionary pragmatists will work with customers to develop lower-carbon products that meet their needs and support their own decarbonization efforts. Beyond the well-known example of substituting renewable electricity for higher-emitting alternatives, other opportunities include responsibly produced natural gas, carbon-neutral LNG cargoes (through offsets), low-carbon copper, carbon capture services for cement producers, green hydrogen for steel producers, green methanol for shipping, and sustainable aviation fuel for airlines. Since customers will want to know what they’re getting when they pay a premium for these greener products, transparency on materials and emissions will be important. 4. Collaborate where it matters and for results. Carbon transition is a problem far too big to be solved by any company on its own, and the need to engage the wider ecosystem of customers, suppliers, peers, governments, and civil society is increasing. Know where to collaborate and where to compete. Pick the few partnerships that can make a difference. Those partnerships should be made across the value chain, with peers and with key stakeholder groups, to reach a critical mass for change (for more, see Chapter 6, “Creating a Coordinated Approach to Decarbonization”). Avoid losing precious time on initiatives where there’s a lot of talk but little action. Ruthlessly deliver results with a clear intent for the partnership, and with early proof points through experimentation. 5. Create green heroes in middle management. Top management may be fully convinced of the need for aggressive decarbonization, given interactions with investors, the board, and key customers. New recruits often have chosen an employer based on its green credentials. Yet some companies underinvest in empowering middle management to get the job done, sending confusing signals on how environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) considerations should connect with other goals for revenues, costs, and safety. Decarbonization can’t be achieved 92 Global Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 without managers who have the tools to make it happen. The only way to effectively empower these potential green heroes is to be extremely clear on what decisions they need to make differently and how to resolve trade-offs when they occur. The organization needs to be trained, guided, and aligned to embed its goals as realistic deliverables. As an example, procurement is critical to address upstream Scope 3 emissions. Managers who have been trained for years to focus on optimizing cost for certain specifications need clear guidance on how to reflect carbon in procurement decisions, next to specs and price (for example, through internal carbon pricing) and the tools to pragmatically assess where to push in the supply chain. Skills must be upgraded throughout the organization, but tailored to specific purposes and people. That starts by investing to understand who’s most affected and who needs the most training, then rolling out support accordingly. While many companies raced to establish their targets in time for COP26, companies in the energy and natural resources sectors often were already managing the difficult task of delivering on those ambitions and building greener businesses. The importance and urgency of decarbonization and the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C are largely undisputed. While many companies raced to establish their targets in time for COP26, companies in the energy and natural resources sectors often were already managing the difficult task of delivering on those ambitions and building greener businesses.

      "﻿Are Oil Companies Ready for the Next Energy Transition in the US? By Marie-Hélène Ben Samoun, Clint Follette, Paul Goydan, and Jamie Webster For oil company executives in the US, the future may be closer than it appears. Low oil and gas prices and the Trump administration’s decision to leave the Paris climate accord might lead some to believe that the fossil fuel industry is immune from disruption. But we believe fundamental forces in mobility and power generation could pressure traditional oil and gas companies to transform the way they do business in the US. Over the next two decades, changes to the US energy landscape could cause a steep decline in domestic gasoline demand while increasing the share of natural gas in the energy mix. In the absence of supportive federal regulations, these changes will mainly be driven by state-level cleanenergy initiatives, global energy efficiency trends, and technological developments. Judging from the experience of other industries, the transitions–when they come–will happen faster than established players expect. Regardless of individual views about the causes of climate change, the business risk of not being prepared for disruption is too high to ignore. Executives need to take a holistic approach to their planning. They need to understand the potential effects of future market developments and identify which parts of their company’s portfolio are at risk and over what time horizon so they can embrace opportunities and manage uncertainties. How the Future for Automobiles Will Affect US Refiners US consumers’ love affair with the automobile has been good for the country’s refineries; gasoline accounts for 60% of their output, and exports are increasing. Americans have shown a remarkably resilient appetite for gasoline-powered cars, especially sport utility vehicles and pickups. However, we believe that gasoline demand in the US could dip by as much as 35% by 2035 if electric-vehicle penetration grows and internal combustion engines become increasingly fuel efficient. The Boston Consulting Group | Are Oil Companies Ready for the Next Energy Transition in the US? 2 Conventional vehicles are becoming more efficient. Despite the administration’s review of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards—the US’s progressively tougher rules on automobile fuel economy—advances in engine technology, driven by demand from international markets, will make conventional automobiles increasingly efficient over the coming years. Faced with slow domestic growth, US car makers are targeting overseas markets, such as China, that promise strong growth but have more stringent vehicle fuel economy requirements. Between now and 2030, annual Chinese new-car sales are projected to be between 25 million and 35 million vehicles; by comparison, sales of new cars in the US will be around 16 million to 17 million vehicles per year. Some argue that car makers will sell energyefficient vehicles only in these overseas markets, while continuing to manufacture less efficient cars for US buyers. However, the scale benefits of making vehicles on a single rather than on multiple platforms will likely mean that car companies will manufacture the same vehicles for all markets. Electric vehicles could go mainstream. EV ownership could rise dramatically over the next decade, eroding demand for conventional vehicles. Countries such as France and the UK will stop selling new gasoline and diesel vehicles in 2040. China is also considering a ban. Even if the US doesn’t follow suit, global EV demand is likely to increase, driving costs down further and supporting US adoption. Lithium-ion batteries, which represent a third of EV costs, have already plummeted in price in just a few years. Improved battery density will enable EVs to travel greater distances before recharging. Charging times (currently more than an hour for a full 300-mile charge on a Tesla Model S at a supercharger station) and the availability of recharging stations will also improve as manufacturers continue to invest. Spending on recharging infrastructure rose to $6 billion in 2016. Electric vehicles may remain an urban phenomenon until their range increases and recharging stations proliferate. But US urbanites still represent a highly addressable market, accounting for 81% of the total population and 67% of miles traveled by US drivers. Ride sharing and self-driving technology will accelerate EV adoption. Digital technologies and changing attitudes to car ownership are likely to accelerate EV penetration. For US millennials (people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s), owning a car is not the aspirational milestone it was for their parents. This generation is a key target audience for the ride-sharing platforms developed by West Coast technology companies Uber and Lyft. Further down the track, autonomous cars could become ubiquitous once tech firms and car makers overcome the obstacles that are holding back their development. In 15 years’ time, if self-driving technology is mature, autonomous cars will be a major disrupter because of their greater convenience, better service levels, and ability to use energy more efficiently than conventional cars. These trends will bolster the shift to fleets of electric vehicles. For the companies that offer shared vehicles, EVs are a better option than conventional cars because they require less maintenance. Users of these vehicles will benefit from other cost advantages as the expense of parking, upkeep, and depreciation is split. In Chicago or New York, we estimate that the cost per passenger mile of a shared, autonomous electric vehicle could be between 40% and 60% less than that of a conventional car. (See The Reimagined Car: Shared, Autonomous, and Electric, BCG Focus, December 2017.) Assuming these trends develop as expected, electric cars could represent more than 20% of US new-car registrations by 2030. Our research suggests that gasoline demand in the US would drop by 10% to 15% by 2025, and by 30% to 35% by 2035, as a result (compared with 2015 levels). Moreover, the use of diesel by heavy trucks in The Boston Consulting Group | Are Oil Companies Ready for the Next Energy Transition in the US? 3 the US could to some extent be replaced by compressed or liquefied natural gas if oil prices stay above $60 per barrel. Electricpowered trucks could further erode demand for diesel in the long term, once range and refueling infrastructure improve. Coping with Falling Demand for Gasoline Demand for refinery products for which there is no credible low-carbon substitute— such as jet fuel, marine fuel, and other refined products used in petrochemicals—will mitigate the decline in gasoline demand but won’t compensate refiners entirely for the loss in revenue. (See the exhibit.) US demand for jet fuel and desulfurized marine fuel could grow by about 1.5% a year, an increase of 30% to 35% between now and 2035. The need for lighter automotive components and energy-efficient insulation will boost demand for chemical products such as ethylene. US petrochemical plants using cheap natural gas as a feedstock have a cost advantage over international rivals. Consequently, demand for products from the US chemicals sector could grow by 2% to 3% a year—an increase of 60% to 65% from 2015 to 2035. But these three sources of demand account for less than 20% of the total output from US refineries. Refineries on the right side of the merit order curve—which ranks assets according to cost level—may be rendered obsolete by the decline in gasoline demand, an argument for refiners to become much more efficient. Exports of competitively priced US gasoline could make up for some of the lost volumes, helped by growing car ownership in developing markets. Yet these markets may try to increase their own refining capacity rather than become too reliant on US product. Natural Gas Will Fuel the US Power Sector We anticipate that demand for natural gas will increase, providing a fillip for oil and gas companies. The US shale gas revolution has shown that the industry can innovate to boost cost efficiencies, and new digital technologies can ensure that this innovation continues. As a result, gas prices are likely to remain competitive, at $2 to $4 per million metric BTUs. Gas will take market share from coal. Several policy initiatives underway in the US are likely to provide support for its coal industry. Even so, natural gas—the cleanest fossil fuel—will remain more competitive than coal. Existing coal-fired plants cost 0 10 20 30 40 Gasoline Diesel Jet fuel Propane (heating, cooking and feedstock for chemicals) Marine fuel2 2015 2025 2035 Total volume, Quadrillion BTU1 –30 to –35% –15 to –20% +30 to +35% +60 to +65% +30 to +35% Change in volume, –10% to –15% 2015–2035 Source: BCG US energy model. 1 Total volume = refinery output plus propane from natural gas liquids. 2 Assuming desulfurized marine fuel after 2020. Refiners Have No Substitute for Gasoline The Boston Consulting Group | Are Oil Companies Ready for the Next Energy Transition in the US? 4 more to operate than gas-fired plants and will become costlier still as they age, while energy from a new coal plant is as much as one-third more expensive than power from a new gas plant. Renewables will take market share from coal and gas. Renewables will take some electricity market share from coal- and gas-fired power stations, particularly less ­efficient “peaker” plants. However, because of the intermittence of solar and wind energy, base load gas plants will still be needed when there’s insufficient sun or wind. According to our models, installation costs for utility-scale solar and wind farms could fall by about 20% over the next ten years. This would make subsidy-free renewables cheaper than gas in regions with abundant sunlight, such as California, but not in others. Still, many states—including those in the Northeast—will continue to expand their renewables portfolios, regardless of federal government policies, because of their expected environmental and job creation benefits. Overall, our models indicate that US demand for natural gas could rise 5% to 10% by 2035. For renewables to compete effectively with gas, energy storage costs would need to be between one-fifth and one-tenth of today’s price. While this will be difficult to achieve, it is not unthinkable given that worldwide investment in grid-scale, batterybased energy storage reached $1 billion in 2016. For oil and gas companies, this could be a significant disruptive factor. The Road Ahead for US Oil and Gas Companies Faced with these accelerating developments, oil companies operating in the US will have to act nimbly if they are to defend their core business. They will need to make smart decisions to increase the proportion of natural gas in their portfolios. And they must embrace digital technologies that can increase operating efficiencies as part of a relentless drive to contain costs and stay competitive with new energy solutions. Some oil and gas companies will be able to adapt their refineries to increase production of jet fuel and petrochemical products, thereby compensating for the sharp drop in gasoline demand. But retrofitting plants with auxiliary units carries a significant cost and will need to be supported by careful analysis of local market needs. Because gasoline is a natural byproduct of other refinery products, US refiners will also have to improve their trading and marketing expertise, especially as exporters such as China, India, the Middle East, and Russia expand their roles. The rise of EVs and more fuel-efficient vehicles may force gasoline stations in some US states to close, which will affect oil companies’ downstream retail operations. As a result, companies may have to find other ways to differentiate their brands from those of rivals and build brand value. And increasing concern about climate change among millennials may require companies to further examine the strategic implications of their own carbon footprint. Along with protecting their traditional business, smart companies will accept that the energy landscape is changing and position themselves to benefit. In Europe, for example, France’s Total is investing in solar energy and battery storage, while Norway’s Statoil is developing offshore wind farms and carbon capture and storage projects. Shell is also investing in offshore wind farms and increasing its footprint in other renewable sources. In the US, ExxonMobil directs part of its R&D budget toward alternative energy and carbon footprint reduction projects. Betting heavily on changes in the energy landscape is the exception, however. At most of the major oil and gas companies, the dedicated budget for alternative energy, energy efficiency, and clean mobility projects is less than 5% of their total annual capital expenditure. There are several reasons for this. For starters, oil and gas companies invest heavily—rightly so—in upstream operations so that they can maintain fossil fuel production levels. But some of the obstacles are structural. The Boston Consulting Group | Are Oil Companies Ready for the Next Energy Transition in the US? 5 The new wave of technology-driven energy transitions (such as localized “behind the meter” power generation) often require a nimbler, more direct relationship with customers, whereas oil companies are traditionally behemoths that focus on large, capital-intensive projects. Technologies that would leverage these companies’ project management and geological expertise—such as carbon capture and storage—are still largely immature and will require significant investment, regulation, or subsidies to be cost effective. Renewable and energy efficiency technologies, such as battery storage, solar, and wind power, are more advanced, but they are also further from oil companies’ traditional skill sets. Complicating matters is the fact that oil companies’ past forays into renewable energy have not always been successful. Furthermore, at companies where alternative energy accounts for a tiny part of the capex budget, renewables do not fit into traditional organizational structures and so can fail to gain momentum. Despite these drawbacks, oil companies have assets that can work in their favor in an evolving world. These include: • Using their size and large R&D budgets to shape future market developments • Leveraging their well-known brands to build stronger customer relationships • Redeploying retail networks to support renewable and clean-energy infrastructure • Deploying their risk management expertise to handle the uncertainties of energy transitions • Using their experience in joint ventures to forge effective partnerships with smaller and more agile innovators US oil companies cannot afford to ignore the energy transitions that could significantly alter their businesses over the coming decades. On the plus side, the US—with its large discrete regional markets, variety of regulations, and unparalleled drive to innovate—can be a testing ground for companies facing similar pressures elsewhere. How to Navigate the Changing Energy Landscape Before taking action, companies should examine the potential impact of different disruptive scenarios on their existing business activities, consider how their current portfolio may evolve over time, and set operational efficiency targets to make these businesses more resilient. They should also consider how stock- and bondholders might react to a change in strategy. We suggest that oil and gas companies considering energy transition opportunities take the following measures to increase their chances of success: • Set out the ambition. Companies should understand which parts of the portfolio are at risk of disruption, over what time frame, and subject to what future market changes. By defining these parameters, executives send a strong internal signal about the need to reallocate resources. Externally, owning and tackling their carbon footprint will enhance the reputation of their brand and enable companies to defend their license to operate. • Build a portfolio outside of fossil fuels. Companies will need to build a portfolio of initiatives that may include technologies far from their core skills. Because the pace and final winners cannot be predicted with certainty, these will need to include competing technologies as well as short- and long-term opportunities. Companies should consider teaming up with innovative startups—or taking small stakes in them—as they learn about new markets. • Establish good governance. Companies must put in place effective governance procedures to manage The Boston Consulting Group | Are Oil Companies Ready for the Next Energy Transition in the US? 6 energy transitions and respond to market developments. Determining which senior executives will be responsible for the company’s alternative and clean-energy portfolio is key to success. By using clear accountability structures, such as a steering committee that reports regularly to senior leaders, companies can maintain momentum as they develop new solutions, fail fast, and respond quickly to energy evolutions. • Be alert to new opportunities. Companies must use monitoring mechanisms to recognize market signals and change their scenarios accordingly. They should also consider investment opportunities where their scale and R&D budget can shape the direction of the market, such as the development of refueling infrastructure at gasoline stations. By taking decisive steps now, US oil companies can road-test strategies to navigate a changing energy landscape, allowing them to learn from their mistakes while many of these developments are still in their infancy. Those that do so will be well placed to manage risks arising from the nature and timing of these shifts and to benefit from future winning technologies.

      "﻿HOW COVID-19 IS CHANGING THE PACE OF ENERGY TRANSITIONS By Alex Dewar, Raad Alkadiri, Rebecca Fitz, and Jamie Webster I n the pre-COVID-19 pandemic environment, the contours of energy transitions toward low-carbon sources were becoming clear. Europe and North America were driving much of the initial adoption of renewable power generation and electrification of energy consumption. Asian countries were generally slower to ramp up low-carbon energy technologies, although their adoption of wind, solar, battery, and electric vehicle (EV) technologies was rapidly accelerating. Still, any decline in oil and natural gas consumption in Europe and North America seemed likely to be offset by growth in Asia, where increasing oil and gas imports would fuel economic growth for the coming decades. Now, however, all bets are off. COVID-19 has changed the strategic and economic calculus for many governments. In any given country, the severity of the outbreak, coupled with the government’s ability to respond to the virus and its economic impact, is influencing the form and structure of substantial economic stimulus measures. And aspects of these stimulus decisions, in turn, may affect the speed and trajectory of energy transitions in surprising ways. To understand how the pandemic may alter energy transitions, BCG conducted a deep dive, region by region, into the stillevolving implications for the energy industry of COVID-19 stimulus measures. We found that while Europe is poised to continue moving in a green direction, some hard-hit countries in Latin America, South Asia, and Africa may be weakened so significantly by COVID-19 that their ability to promote energy transitions will be severely constrained—assuming that it was a policy priority in the first place. In addition, one entirely unanticipated trend emerged from our analysis: in the wake of COVID-19, the pace of energy transitions—specifically, the adoption of renewables and electrification of transport—may increase in some Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian countries. Several factors support this conclusion. First, many leading Asian economies—including China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore—have suffered relatively few Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 2 adverse health and economic impacts from COVID-19. As a result, they are in a good position to make the substantial investments in energy infrastructure needed to facilitate energy transitions. Second, they stand to gain the most by shifting to renewable energy generation and to electrified energy consumption, particularly in the transportation sector via heightened EV adoption. And third, the stimulus measures and policy reforms that these Asian countries have adopted so far, although ostensibly aimed at buoying industrial competitiveness, are also likely to hasten energy transitions. If this shift occurs, oil and gas companies will have to revise their investment and operational plans to navigate a landscape in which Asia does not function as the significant growth engine in coming years that they had expected. In particular, such a shift could quicken the arrival of peak oil demand and heighten uncertainty in an already heavily disrupted industry. In China and South Korea alone, policies announced in response to COVID-19 could reduce oil demand by up to 3 million barrels per day in 2040, according to our estimates. Although companies that had anticipated sustained growth in oil and gas demand in Asia may find this potential trend challenging, it will create new opportunities for investments in low-carbon energy sources. In any event, energy companies throughout the world will need to reassess their exposure to markets in response to the impacts of COVID-19, associated government policy measures, and the resulting pace of future energy transitions. Learning from an Earlier Crisis Looking back to the global recession of 2007–2009, we can see how powerfully government responses to an economic crisis can influence the energy industry’s trajectory, chiefly because energy infrastructure is interwoven with industrial policy and economic performance. At that time, multiple governments implemented green stimulus programs, reasoning that a greater commitment to renewable energy development could jolt economic development in the short run while providing long-term competitive benefits. (See Exhibit 1.) These policy measures aimed at advancing energy transitions were not motivated entirely by concerns about climate change. In large part, US and European governments directed stimulus spending toward renewables to generate new domestic construction, installation, and manufacturing jobs. In the US, loans, grants, and tax credits helped trigger growth in solar capacity that has averaged 50% per year over the past decade and encouraged tens of billions of dollars in private investments in solarrelated projects. Similarly, in Europe, direct stimulus investment in offshore wind power development programs and subsidized payments to wind power producers has driven 1000% capacity growth since 2009 and helped make Europe the global leader in wind energy. By contrast, countries in Northeast Asia adopted renewables-related stimulus policies that emphasized improving global economic competitiveness in manufacturing and exports. For instance, a focus on “green industrial policy” in China, South Korea, and Japan helped those countries develop greater efficiency and lower-cost supply chains for solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery technologies, helping their domestic firms cement an international leadership position in these areas. Chinese subsidies for domestic solar manufacturers increased domestic production of PV panels by more than 100%, leading to sharply reduced costs and increased sales around the world. A parallel success story occurred in South Korea with respect to battery technologies. Due in part to government support, Korean firms now lead the global market for lithium-ion batteries and have played a key role in research efforts to make EV batteries more affordable, reducing EV prices to a level closer to those of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Is COVID-19 Different? At first blush, the COVID-19 pandemic might seem so unlike the 2007–2009 recession that its impact on the energy transition Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 3 would be quite different, too. In the earlier crisis, the clear goal for governments was to stimulate and sustain new economic activity. But in today’s pandemic, the primary challenge for governments is to respond to a health crisis while minimizing the impacts of unprecedented short-term unemployment. Governments are also more constrained now, having to cover huge medical and social welfare expenses while anticipating much smaller tax revenues. In short, COVID-19 fiscal responses are less about jump-starting new economic activity and more about keeping drowning elements of the economy afloat. Still, despite very clear differences between today and 12 years ago, many COVID-19- driven government stimulus measures have the potential to accelerate energy transitions. Although the coronavirus pandemic has touched virtually every part of the world, its fiscal and economic impact has varied significantly from region to region. In addition, renewables, batteries, and electrification of energy consumption have become key drivers of economic growth in their own right in some regions—and as a result, these sectors pose attractive options for further boosting economic activity to governments that have the fiscal latitude to pursue them. To gauge how governments’ COVID-19 responses may affect their countries’ energy transitions, we assessed 35 countries on four different dimensions: • The Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Society, and the Economy.

Energy transitions require stable social and economic environments to effectively deploy substantial amounts of capital. • The Ability to Respond. Because investments and fiscal support for new energy technologies are expensive, they are feasible only when governments and key energy sector actors—including leading utilities and national oil companies—have relatively strong balance sheets and access to healthy capital markets. • Incentives to Shift Course. Countries that see greater economic benefit and opportunities for improved competitiveness as a result of shifting their energy mix and supporting lower carbon pathways are more likely to adopt or maintain that strategy even during difficult periods. • Early Indicators. Initial COVID-19 stimulus measures and other policy changes can provide hints about the future trajectory of energy transitions as the world moves out of crisis mode and into economic recovery. Which Regions Stand Out? When we used this four-part framework to assess the G20 countries and other large emerging markets, we found that shifting toward renewables and electrification of energy consumption has the most potential to accelerate in European and in various Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian countries. These regions have weathered COVID-19 relatively well—when viewed through the lens of health, social, and economic impact—and their fiscal positions are sufficiently strong to adopt a creative and forward-looking COVID-19 stimulus plan. (See Exhibit 2.) Globally, South Korea, Germany, Japan, and China are among the leaders on both of these criteria. By responding quickly to the health challenges of COVID-19, these countries have enabled themselves to focus more immediately on the economic challenges generated by the pandemic. As a result, the GDP and capital market impacts from the coronavirus have been somewhat muted in these nations, resulting in stronger public and private balance sheets. Moreover, their public and private sectors tend to have a high borrowing capacity, as government interest rates are relatively low and corporate bond ratings are strong. As a result of these advantages, governments and energy sector actors can more freely invest in innovation and growth strategies. For European countries, promoting innovation to drive energy transitions is not new. But by maintaining relatively strong economic health during the pandemic, they are now in an excellent position to continue their shift toward renewables. So while the European Commission’s Green Deal— which aims to achieve a 50% reduction in carbon emissions in the euro bloc by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and net zero carbon emissions by 2050—and green stimulus measures have significant implications, they reflect deepening support for policies designed to shift the region onto a lowercarbon pathway. For Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian countries, the story is different. Many of these countries have been slower to adopt renewables and were expected to depend heavily on oil, natural gas, and coal for years to come. Yet many Asian economies have much to gain from facilitating swifter energy transitions. For one thing, their energy intensity—the amount of energy consumed per unit of economic output—is on the high end, largely because manufacturing is such a substantial segment of their economies, especially in China, South Korea, and Vietnam. And to meet their energy needs, these countries generally are depend on fossil-fuel imports to a greater extent than do countries in many other regions. (See Exhibit 3.) As a result, any shift toward domestically produced renewable energy would simultaneously improve their energy efficiency and strengthen their economies’ balance of payments. Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 5 Another important consideration is the improvement in the cost competitiveness of renewables in the region in recent years. In China, solar and wind power now costs less than coal on a levelized basis, which measures the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime; and in South Korea and Japan it is rapidly approaching parity with coal. (See Exhibit 4.) The declining cost of renewables, together with the energy intensity and import dependence of many Asian economies, provides a meaningful incentive for those countries to consider facilitating a faster transition to renewables in the power sector. The Asian EV Strategy Although Asian governments have logical reasons to pursue faster energy transitions, the paths that they are taking are not necessarily similar to those used in other regions or in the past recession. In particular, the strategy emerging this time appears to focus on EVs. So far, of the more than $600 billion of “green” government stimulus measures that have been announced globally, China has committed to $200 billion and South Korea to $60 billion. Within these stimulus measures, the promotion of EV technology innovation and adoption is a key priority. (See Exhibit 5.) For example, a signal feature of China’s stimulus package involves funding to increase its EV charging infrastructure by 50% and to improve its power grid capacity and stability in support of faster growth of the EV market. In South Korea, the socalled Green New Deal allocates money for innovation in EV and battery production.

LCOE = levelized cost of energy; RES = renewable energy source. Exhibit 4 | Wind and Solar Are Becoming More Cost Competitive in Asia Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 7 Beyond adopting stimulus spending measures directed at innovation and infrastructure, Asian governments are pursuing other policies to accelerate EV adoption. For instance, South Korea has extended its EV subsidy program and increased its 2025 targets for EV and hydrogen vehicle adoption. Similarly, China has extended its EV subsidy scheme and has announced a new “cash for clunkers” program to encourage new vehicle adoption. In February, before the pandemic started, Singapore announced that it would be phasing out ICE vehicles by 2040, as well as offering new subsidies for EV sales and expanding charging facilities. In the wake of the pandemic, Singapore has recommitted to these policies. The emphasis on EVs by various large Asian countries reflects, in part, their interest in competing in the rapidly growing global EV market. The cost of EVs has already begun to decline dramatically in recent years, and BCG projects that the total cost of ownership of EVs will likely be lower than that of ICE vehicles by the mid2020s in many markets. Automotive OEMs and component suppliers that establish a foothold in the market now will be well situated to gain from rapid market growth in coming years. Although EVs account for only 1% of global car registrations, they are the fastest-growing segment of the automotive market, with year-on-year growth of 40%. For export-dependent Asian countries, directing COVID-19 stimulus spending toward further enhancing their position in the global EV market looks like win-win opportunity. The Asian Implications From a macro perspective, the most disruptive outcome of our analysis for the energy industry lies in the potential acceleration of transportation electrification in Asia. This shift could significantly affect the future trajectory of oil demand. The International Energy Agency had forecast that the Asia-Pacific region would contribute around 80% of oil demand growth (7.6 million barrels) through 2040, with China alone responsible for more than one-third of that increase in oil usage. That estimate had assumed that EVs would not become prevalent in Asia until the 2030s. But if EVs become mainstream before the end of this decade, the global peak in oil demand would come sooner. Indeed, our analysis indicates that the policies adopted in China Announced Chinese and South Korean green stimulus packages are as large as the EU's Transportation sector and EVs are a major focus of stimulus measures Approved and announced global green stimulus ($billions) China EV and infrastructure spending EV charging infrastructure HV transmission and other infrastructure EV subsidy extension and \"cash for clunkers\" South Korea Green New Deal stimulus R&D funding for EVs and batteries EV subsidy extension Acceleration of targets for EV and hydrogen EU Green Deal Hydrogen investment Energy efficiency support Low-carbon vehicle support 260 600 200 60 80 0 200 400 600 China South Korea Rest of world EU Total Sources: BNEF; Vivid Economics; Energy Policy Tracker; press reports; BCG analysis. Exhibit 5 | Green Stimulus and Policy Measures in Asia Are Substantial, with a Strong Focus on Electric Vehicles Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 8 and South Korea alone in the wake of COVID-19 could reduce oil demand by up to 3 million barrels per day in 2040. At the same time, natural gas demand growth, which Asian markets were also expected to drive, could take a hit as wind and solar power grow in the region, sustained by a quickened focus on renewable generation and battery storage. Coal demand, on the other hand, may be more stable if stimulus measures do not include provisions designed to drive down greenhouse gas emissions overall. Coal is less expensive than natural gas in the region and is likely to remain more competitive with renewables for a longer period of time unless governments impose a surcharge on CO2 emissions. Both China and Japan have indicated that they will continue to implement plans for additional new coal capacity. Consequently, as we move into the next decade, coal plus renewables may well be the fastest-growing sources of power generation in the region. How Companies Should Respond Given the scale of market impacts that can result from governments’ policy responses to COVID-19, energy companies may need to reconsider their assumptions about the pace of energy transitions and the resulting impact on demand. In our view, oil and gas companies in particular should take three main steps in response to the new realities posed by the post-COVID-19 environment: • As they revise their economic planning assumptions to reflect market shifts brought about by COVID-19, oil and gas companies should carefully consider the potential for accelerating energy transitions, especially in Asia. This may have significant implications for some companies, impacting strategies, portfolios, and investment decisions. • They should also revisit capital allocation processes in new demand scenarios. For instance, many refining capacity investments assume downstream oil market growth in Asia. Although petrochemicals demand will likely remain strong in this region, energy companies must address the risk of weaker demand for ground fuels. Meanwhile, if natural gas usage in power generation is less robust than expected, the importance of marketing liquefied natural gas (LNG) directly to industrial and utility customers will rise. But such a marketing effort represents a more complicated and capital-intensive business model than LNG sellers are accustomed to. As a result, oil and gas companies’ capital allocation plans should identify risks as well as new opportunities. • Oil and gas companies need to take a nimble and flexible approach to investment in low-carbon-energy technologies if they are to adapt to the new environment. Increased publicsector R&D investments could alter the development pathway of different low-carbon energy technologies. In particular, greater government funding for electrification of medium- and heavy-duty transportation could accelerate the adoption of electric powertrains over biofuel or hydrogen alternatives. This, in turn, could upend companies’ technology strategies based on previous assumptions about the pace of technology development and the probable allocation of government research dollars. Determining which technologies to provide seed money for will be critical for energy companies navigating a rapidly shifting future. Of course, as oil and gas companies face a more challenging landscape, companies or investors that participate in power value chains may identify new opportunities. COVID-19 stimulus spending and policy reforms could rapidly create or advance markets for wind, solar, and battery supply chains; and automakers, already anticipating a period of more rapid EV adoption, may find that the market matures even more quickly than they expected. In turn, these developments could promote the emergence of other low-carbon tech- Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 9 nologies, particularly the production and use of green hydrogen from renewable power generation. The value of new business opportunities from accelerating energy transitions in Asia could be substantial. Aside from investments in new renewable and battery capacity, modernizing power grids to better integrate renewables and expanding transport electrification can create incremental value pools worth billions of dollars. The possibilities for international utilities or investors to participate in these growth opportunities will vary by region and time horizon, however, as many countries have yet to go through the process of power market liberalization. Consequently, in seeking to profit from the energy transition, companies and investors must assess the opportunities and associated risks country by country. Looking back, we can see that government responses to the 2007–2009 recession and its aftermath helped usher in a decade of remarkable advances in renewable power and battery technology. Those advances involved less than $500 billion in green stimulus spending globally, demonstrating how well timed the contributions were and how well poised renewable technologies were to take off. Already, in response to COVID-19, governments have committed at least $600 billion to total green stimulus, with more likely to come. And as occurred during the last global recession, Asian countries seem ready to play a central role in accelerating the energy transitions. Energy companies must take this possibility seriously and prepare for both risks and opportunities that may accompany it.

      "﻿HOW COVID-19 IS CHANGING THE PACE OF ENERGY TRANSITIONS By Alex Dewar, Raad Alkadiri, Rebecca Fitz, and Jamie Webster I n the pre-COVID-19 pandemic environment, the contours of energy transitions toward low-carbon sources were becoming clear. Europe and North America were driving much of the initial adoption of renewable power generation and electrification of energy consumption. Asian countries were generally slower to ramp up low-carbon energy technologies, although their adoption of wind, solar, battery, and electric vehicle (EV) technologies was rapidly accelerating. Still, any decline in oil and natural gas consumption in Europe and North America seemed likely to be offset by growth in Asia, where increasing oil and gas imports would fuel economic growth for the coming decades. Now, however, all bets are off. COVID-19 has changed the strategic and economic calculus for many governments. In any given country, the severity of the outbreak, coupled with the government’s ability to respond to the virus and its economic impact, is influencing the form and structure of substantial economic stimulus measures. And aspects of these stimulus decisions, in turn, may affect the speed and trajectory of energy transitions in surprising ways. To understand how the pandemic may alter energy transitions, BCG conducted a deep dive, region by region, into the stillevolving implications for the energy industry of COVID-19 stimulus measures. We found that while Europe is poised to continue moving in a green direction, some hard-hit countries in Latin America, South Asia, and Africa may be weakened so significantly by COVID-19 that their ability to promote energy transitions will be severely constrained—assuming that it was a policy priority in the first place. In addition, one entirely unanticipated trend emerged from our analysis: in the wake of COVID-19, the pace of energy transitions—specifically, the adoption of renewables and electrification of transport—may increase in some Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian countries. Several factors support this conclusion. First, many leading Asian economies—including China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore—have suffered relatively few Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 2 adverse health and economic impacts from COVID-19. As a result, they are in a good position to make the substantial investments in energy infrastructure needed to facilitate energy transitions. Second, they stand to gain the most by shifting to renewable energy generation and to electrified energy consumption, particularly in the transportation sector via heightened EV adoption. And third, the stimulus measures and policy reforms that these Asian countries have adopted so far, although ostensibly aimed at buoying industrial competitiveness, are also likely to hasten energy transitions. If this shift occurs, oil and gas companies will have to revise their investment and operational plans to navigate a landscape in which Asia does not function as the significant growth engine in coming years that they had expected. In particular, such a shift could quicken the arrival of peak oil demand and heighten uncertainty in an already heavily disrupted industry. In China and South Korea alone, policies announced in response to COVID-19 could reduce oil demand by up to 3 million barrels per day in 2040, according to our estimates. Although companies that had anticipated sustained growth in oil and gas demand in Asia may find this potential trend challenging, it will create new opportunities for investments in low-carbon energy sources. In any event, energy companies throughout the world will need to reassess their exposure to markets in response to the impacts of COVID-19, associated government policy measures, and the resulting pace of future energy transitions. Learning from an Earlier Crisis Looking back to the global recession of 2007–2009, we can see how powerfully government responses to an economic crisis can influence the energy industry’s trajectory, chiefly because energy infrastructure is interwoven with industrial policy and economic performance. At that time, multiple governments implemented green stimulus programs, reasoning that a greater commitment to renewable energy development could jolt economic development in the short run while providing long-term competitive benefits. (See Exhibit 1.) These policy measures aimed at advancing energy transitions were not motivated entirely by concerns about climate change. In large part, US and European governments directed stimulus spending toward renewables to generate new domestic construction, installation, and manufacturing jobs. In the US, loans, grants, and tax credits helped trigger growth in solar capacity that has averaged 50% per year over the past decade and encouraged tens of billions of dollars in private investments in solarrelated projects. Similarly, in Europe, direct stimulus investment in offshore wind power development programs and subsidized payments to wind power producers has driven 1000% capacity growth since 2009 and helped make Europe the global leader in wind energy. By contrast, countries in Northeast Asia adopted renewables-related stimulus policies that emphasized improving global economic competitiveness in manufacturing and exports. For instance, a focus on “green industrial policy” in China, South Korea, and Japan helped those countries develop greater efficiency and lower-cost supply chains for solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery technologies, helping their domestic firms cement an international leadership position in these areas. Chinese subsidies for domestic solar manufacturers increased domestic production of PV panels by more than 100%, leading to sharply reduced costs and increased sales around the world. A parallel success story occurred in South Korea with respect to battery technologies. Due in part to government support, Korean firms now lead the global market for lithium-ion batteries and have played a key role in research efforts to make EV batteries more affordable, reducing EV prices to a level closer to those of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Is COVID-19 Different? At first blush, the COVID-19 pandemic might seem so unlike the 2007–2009 recession that its impact on the energy transition Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 3 would be quite different, too. In the earlier crisis, the clear goal for governments was to stimulate and sustain new economic activity. But in today’s pandemic, the primary challenge for governments is to respond to a health crisis while minimizing the impacts of unprecedented short-term unemployment. Governments are also more constrained now, having to cover huge medical and social welfare expenses while anticipating much smaller tax revenues. In short, COVID-19 fiscal responses are less about jump-starting new economic activity and more about keeping drowning elements of the economy afloat. Still, despite very clear differences between today and 12 years ago, many COVID-19- driven government stimulus measures have the potential to accelerate energy transitions. Although the coronavirus pandemic has touched virtually every part of the world, its fiscal and economic impact has varied significantly from region to region. In addition, renewables, batteries, and electrification of energy consumption have become key drivers of economic growth in their own right in some regions—and as a result, these sectors pose attractive options for further boosting economic activity to governments that have the fiscal latitude to pursue them. To gauge how governments’ COVID-19 responses may affect their countries’ energy transitions, we assessed 35 countries on four different dimensions: • The Impact of COVID-19 on Health, Society, and the Economy.

Exhibit 4 | Wind and Solar Are Becoming More Cost Competitive in Asia Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 7 Beyond adopting stimulus spending measures directed at innovation and infrastructure, Asian governments are pursuing other policies to accelerate EV adoption. For instance, South Korea has extended its EV subsidy program and increased its 2025 targets for EV and hydrogen vehicle adoption. Similarly, China has extended its EV subsidy scheme and has announced a new “cash for clunkers” program to encourage new vehicle adoption. In February, before the pandemic started, Singapore announced that it would be phasing out ICE vehicles by 2040, as well as offering new subsidies for EV sales and expanding charging facilities. In the wake of the pandemic, Singapore has recommitted to these policies. The emphasis on EVs by various large Asian countries reflects, in part, their interest in competing in the rapidly growing global EV market. The cost of EVs has already begun to decline dramatically in recent years, and BCG projects that the total cost of ownership of EVs will likely be lower than that of ICE vehicles by the mid2020s in many markets. Automotive OEMs and component suppliers that establish a foothold in the market now will be well situated to gain from rapid market growth in coming years. Although EVs account for only 1% of global car registrations, they are the fastest-growing segment of the automotive market, with year-on-year growth of 40%. For export-dependent Asian countries, directing COVID-19 stimulus spending toward further enhancing their position in the global EV market looks like win-win opportunity. The Asian Implications From a macro perspective, the most disruptive outcome of our analysis for the energy industry lies in the potential acceleration of transportation electrification in Asia. This shift could significantly affect the future trajectory of oil demand. The International Energy Agency had forecast that the Asia-Pacific region would contribute around 80% of oil demand growth (7.6 million barrels) through 2040, with China alone responsible for more than one-third of that increase in oil usage. That estimate had assumed that EVs would not become prevalent in Asia until the 2030s. But if EVs become mainstream before the end of this decade, the global peak in oil demand would come sooner. Indeed, our analysis indicates that the policies adopted in China Announced Chinese and South Korean green stimulus packages are as large as the EU's Transportation sector and EVs are a major focus of stimulus measures Approved and announced global green stimulus ($billions) China EV and infrastructure spending EV charging infrastructure HV transmission and other infrastructure EV subsidy extension and \"cash for clunkers\" South Korea Green New Deal stimulus R&D funding for EVs and batteries EV subsidy extension Acceleration of targets for EV and hydrogen EU Green Deal Hydrogen investment Energy efficiency support Low-carbon vehicle support 260 600 200 60 80 0 200 400 600 China South Korea Rest of world EU Total Sources: BNEF; Vivid Economics; Energy Policy Tracker; press reports; BCG analysis. Exhibit 5 | Green Stimulus and Policy Measures in Asia Are Substantial, with a Strong Focus on Electric Vehicles Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 8 and South Korea alone in the wake of COVID-19 could reduce oil demand by up to 3 million barrels per day in 2040. At the same time, natural gas demand growth, which Asian markets were also expected to drive, could take a hit as wind and solar power grow in the region, sustained by a quickened focus on renewable generation and battery storage. Coal demand, on the other hand, may be more stable if stimulus measures do not include provisions designed to drive down greenhouse gas emissions overall. Coal is less expensive than natural gas in the region and is likely to remain more competitive with renewables for a longer period of time unless governments impose a surcharge on CO2 emissions. Both China and Japan have indicated that they will continue to implement plans for additional new coal capacity. Consequently, as we move into the next decade, coal plus renewables may well be the fastest-growing sources of power generation in the region. How Companies Should Respond Given the scale of market impacts that can result from governments’ policy responses to COVID-19, energy companies may need to reconsider their assumptions about the pace of energy transitions and the resulting impact on demand. In our view, oil and gas companies in particular should take three main steps in response to the new realities posed by the post-COVID-19 environment: • As they revise their economic planning assumptions to reflect market shifts brought about by COVID-19, oil and gas companies should carefully consider the potential for accelerating energy transitions, especially in Asia. This may have significant implications for some companies, impacting strategies, portfolios, and investment decisions. • They should also revisit capital allocation processes in new demand scenarios. For instance, many refining capacity investments assume downstream oil market growth in Asia. Although petrochemicals demand will likely remain strong in this region, energy companies must address the risk of weaker demand for ground fuels. Meanwhile, if natural gas usage in power generation is less robust than expected, the importance of marketing liquefied natural gas (LNG) directly to industrial and utility customers will rise. But such a marketing effort represents a more complicated and capital-intensive business model than LNG sellers are accustomed to. As a result, oil and gas companies’ capital allocation plans should identify risks as well as new opportunities. • Oil and gas companies need to take a nimble and flexible approach to investment in low-carbon-energy technologies if they are to adapt to the new environment. Increased publicsector R&D investments could alter the development pathway of different low-carbon energy technologies. In particular, greater government funding for electrification of medium- and heavy-duty transportation could accelerate the adoption of electric powertrains over biofuel or hydrogen alternatives. This, in turn, could upend companies’ technology strategies based on previous assumptions about the pace of technology development and the probable allocation of government research dollars. Determining which technologies to provide seed money for will be critical for energy companies navigating a rapidly shifting future. Of course, as oil and gas companies face a more challenging landscape, companies or investors that participate in power value chains may identify new opportunities. COVID-19 stimulus spending and policy reforms could rapidly create or advance markets for wind, solar, and battery supply chains; and automakers, already anticipating a period of more rapid EV adoption, may find that the market matures even more quickly than they expected. In turn, these developments could promote the emergence of other low-carbon tech- Boston Consulting Group | How COVID-19 Is Changing the Pace of Energy Transitions 9 nologies, particularly the production and use of green hydrogen from renewable power generation. The value of new business opportunities from accelerating energy transitions in Asia could be substantial. Aside from investments in new renewable and battery capacity, modernizing power grids to better integrate renewables and expanding transport electrification can create incremental value pools worth billions of dollars. The possibilities for international utilities or investors to participate in these growth opportunities will vary by region and time horizon, however, as many countries have yet to go through the process of power market liberalization. Consequently, in seeking to profit from the energy transition, companies and investors must assess the opportunities and associated risks country by country. Looking back, we can see that government responses to the 2007–2009 recession and its aftermath helped usher in a decade of remarkable advances in renewable power and battery technology. Those advances involved less than $500 billion in green stimulus spending globally, demonstrating how well timed the contributions were and how well poised renewable technologies were to take off. Already, in response to COVID-19, governments have committed at least $600 billion to total green stimulus, with more likely to come. And as occurred during the last global recession, Asian countries seem ready to play a central role in accelerating the energy transitions. Energy companies must take this possibility seriously and prepare for both risks and opportunities that may accompany it.

      "﻿© 2022 Boston Consulting Group 1 An Inflection Point for the Energy Transition JULY 04, 2022 By Nikolaus Lang, Maurice Berns, Anders Porsborg-Smith, Jamie Webster, and Tim Figures Eight realities are shaping the “energy trilemma.” Here’s how business and government can keep the energy transition on track. The energy trilemma is not new. For decades, companies and policymakers have struggled to balance the three goals of ensuring a secure and reliable energy supply, at an affordable cost, with minimal environmental impact. But the redoubling of global ambition on climate change at COP26, followed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, makes the challenge even greater, as the prices of energy and other commodities surge across the globe. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 2 What will happen next? In some regions, these issues may cause the energy transition to accelerate, driving security and objectives simultaneously. But energy costs have increased sharply and likely will remain elevated for some time, which could lead to a backlash against climate action if end users’ expectations and costs are not managed carefully. In short, we are at an energy inflection point. Business and government must develop new strategies to ensure that the pursuit of critical energy goals remains on track. Eight realities will shape the contours of our energy future. We’ll consider each in turn. The Power of Policy Making Policymakers will continue to rewrite the rules of the game over the next 12 months, and the effect of these policies may endure for decades. The fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only the latest example of how concerns over energy security alter the direction of policy, with impacts on supply and demand in many regions. The 1979 energy crisis, which occurred in the wake of the Iranian Revolution, kick-started the global interest in renewable energy. It also led to an investment in research and policies that accelerated the transition away from oil. Japan, for example, enacted its Energy Conservation Act, which has helped to decrease oil’s share of the country’s energy consumption from 72% to just 38% today. Many other countries enacted supply-side policies to find domestic alternatives to imported oil and gas; rather than accelerating the move to renewables, those moves boosted coal production. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 3 Fast-forward to today: Germany has rewritten its energy strategy virtually overnight after relying for decades on Russian oil and gas imports as a pillar of its economic growth strategy. Clearly, geopolitical events have a significant impact on energy policy. But unlike in the past, climate action is also now a critical component of regulatory, legislative, and industry thinking. Energy security policies can have far-reaching effects. Often they create constituencies with an incentive to retain or even expand the policies further. Look no further than the US Renewable Fuel Standard, which was intended to reduce emissions and kick-start demand for biofuels by mandating minimum sales volumes. In practice, this has become a cash cow for US farmers and led to a change in US land use from food to fuel production. It has also strengthened the farm lobby, which campaigns hard to keep these subsidies in place. New Energy Security Challenges The global dependence on hydrocarbons will likely decline over time. But new dependencies on critical minerals and technology will arise, requiring careful management. The minerals powering the energy transition will need additional investment across multiple countries and along the entire value chain. These supply sources and demand sinks will create new points of vulnerability and alter the geopolitics of energy policy. An estimated $2 trillion in investment is required to limit global warming to the oft-stated goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. This investment will, in turn,  The fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only the latest example of how concerns over energy security alter the direction of policy. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 4 create new centers of economic and geopolitical advantage for countries with ready sources of lithium, nickel, rare earths, and other critical minerals. As a result, governments will increasingly look to secure supplies of critical minerals and energy from domestic or friendly sources—a practice known as “friendshoring.” The EU’s critical minerals strategy, for example, calls for diversifying and securing the supply of some 30 commodities, underscoring how much work remains in sourcing key components of the energy transition from reliable and politically favorable markets. Broader environmental, social, and geopolitical considerations will also play an increasingly important role. For example, 70% of global cobalt production is currently located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has a poor record on workers’ rights. Similarly, 20% of the global nickel supply comes from Russia and can no longer be exported to Western markets because of sanctions. Proposals such as the EU battery passport—which would track a battery’s material provenance, chemical makeup, and sustainability impact—are designed to ensure the energy transition does not come at an unacceptable social or environmental price. A Shortage of Energy Efficiency Measures Reducing the consumption of energy through more-efficient use is often referred to as the “first fuel,” because this approach can reduce use the most and be implemented relatively quickly. It also has positive cost and climate implications. To that end, the IEA has put out a ten-point plan to reduce oil demand by 2.7 mmb/d within four months, largely by changing consumers’ behavior. But no country has to date enacted policies to immediately restrict energy use or sharply increase efficiencies. Instead, countries are contemplating or implementing subsidies—such as suspending taxes, employing price caps, or providing discounts —to reduce the impact of higher prices on end users. We see this happening in Europe. France, for example, has spent €20 billion to moderate gas and power © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 5 costs and is considering fully nationalizing EDF, the national electric utility. Spain has imposed price caps on fuel, extending a cap already in place on household energy usage. And the UK has lowered taxes on road fuel while offering discounts to domestic users of gas and electricity. These policies will have the opposite impact of efficiency measures, boosting demand at the margins and potentially creating market shortfalls. Such scarcity can create a doom loop, in which scarcity or perceived scarcity leads to hoarding, which exacerbates scarcity. This occurs frequently during the US hurricane season, when motorists preemptively fill up their tanks, causing fuel stations to run empty. Higher Decarbonization Costs Higher costs are forcing governments to make tougher tradeoffs between affordability and decarbonization, a situation that often favors fossil fuels in the very near term. In several countries, it is now cheaper to replace natural gas with coal, which has approximately 40% more carbon emissions and contains particulate matter that worsens air quality. In Europe, where carbon pricing is well established, permit costs have, to some extent, prevented this shift, though Germany is now planning on maintaining some coal plants to provide optionality when natural gas prices are high. Indeed, the effects of the energy transition could have significant repercussions. In Brazil, where consumers can choose among fuels with a variety of ethanol levels, the higher gasoline prices are pushing mills to create more ethanol, reducing sugar availability globally.  Higher costs are forcing governments to make tougher tradeoffs between affordability and decarbonization, a situation that often favors fossil fuels in the very near term. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 6 This will further push up prices, potentially increasing social unrest. In addition, patchy implementation of nations’ COP26 carbon reduction commitments could lead to disparities in energy costs between high-action and low-action regions, a situation that would incentivize offshoring. New initiatives, such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which taxes imports of energy-intensive products, may help resolve the issue. Higher commodity prices, due in part to the war in Ukraine, may disrupt cost curves in both directions and across commodity types. The input costs for three key metals (nickel, lithium, and cobalt) for a 60 KWh electric-vehicle battery have risen sharply, from $1,395 a year ago to $7,400 in April 2022, which could slow the uptake of EV penetration. At the same time, springtime prices for jet fuel in New York Harbor exceeded $300/b, a price so high that sustainable aviation fuel is not just competitive, it’s cheaper. And EU carbon prices have hit new highs of €100/ton, making a new range of decarbonization options more affordable. Government Investment and “Greenflation” Renewable power producers were experiencing constraints before Russia invaded Ukraine and cut off supply. Several wind OEMs had cited supply chain issues involving electrical components, balsa trees needed for blades, and general capacity constraints. Now, significant power and gas infrastructure investments are required to reorient European supply networks away from Russia and toward liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Some early signs are promising: Poland and Bulgaria have both used LNG imports from neighboring countries to offset the lack of Russian supply. But this shift will take time and money. And in the meantime, it could well lead to additional supply chain logjams and further cost inflation for critical minerals essential to renewable technologies, a phenomenon known as “greenflation.” © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 7 To spur the energy transition, governments are likely to reexamine their permitting processes to shorten the time needed to put new capacity on the market. Indeed, this is a central pillar of the recent REPowerEU initiative, which seeks to accelerate the EU’s green transition by diversifying gas supplies, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, speeding up permitting processes, and increasing energy efficiency. Greater Energy Price Volatility Volatility levels for Brent oil have risen nearly 100% since February 2022, compared with the same period in 2021. TTF natural gas price volatility is up 26% in the same period. Volatility has also spread to carbon markets. As a result, oil and gas companies are delaying investment decisions. Lowcarbon investments are at particular risk because of relatively increased sensitivity to interest rates and because access to financing is increasingly subject to contractual proof of offtake and floor prices. The long-term impact of EU energy sanctions on Russia and the broader world remains to be seen, with the bloc struggling to ramp up action because of the dependence of some of its members on Russian energy exports. Meanwhile, a ban on insuring cargos of Russian oil is being considered, in addition to measures to reduce Russia’s ability to sell its oil to other customers. Insufficient Energy Supply  Because of high price volatility, oil and gas companies are delaying investment decisions. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 8 The global energy supply was not receiving sufficient investment before the invasion. It must now be ramped up significantly to avoid price spikes. Investments to boost oil and gas production have been too low in recent years, even if peak demand has been near at hand. The growing importance of energy security and the need to bolster supply chains mandate a level of energy investment not seen since 2007. New technologies, too, have not received sufficient funding. In 2021, investments rose only modestly. So far in 2022, investments in direct air capture technology have been sporadic. Investments in other new technologies need to grow substantially if we are to meet environmental and energy security goals. About $800 million has been spent on these technologies in the first four months of 2022; in the past four years, approximately $400 million was spent. While this is an impressive level of growth, it still falls far short of the total annual investment of $3 trillion to $4 trillion needed to fund the energy transition. Developed economies are also expected to invest more in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), hydrogen, and long-duration storage. Even before the war in Ukraine, nuclear power was experiencing a renaissance, largely in the developing world. The UK has also now included significant new nuclear power, modular in nature, in its recently released British Energy Security Strategy. Given the heightened interest in a low-carbon baseload that is not tied to hydrocarbon supply, nuclear technologies, especially new ones such as small modular reactors, will likely assume a greater share of the energy mix. Inadequate Energy Access in the Developing World One hundred million people lost access to energy because of the economic impacts of COVID-19, reversing the growth in access that had occurred during much of the past decade. With higher energy prices and the challenges of importing needed materials since the invasion of Ukraine, the number of people without access to energy will grow. Europe’s lack of non-Russian sources of natural gas and greater © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 9 renewable energy capacity are helping boost prices there. These issues have already impacted the ability to pay for natural gas in countries such as Pakistan; Sri Lanka, too, is struggling with increased energy poverty. Food and fuel protests are quickly becoming a regular occurrence in many parts of the world. There is also growing anger in the developing world about inconsistent messaging: countries are being told not to develop domestic natural gas resources, while Europe is renewing its focus on building out the bloc’s resources as well as its import and transport capabilities. Given that this part of the world will be responsible for a large proportion of future emissions growth, developed countries should underwrite the agreed-to $100 billion annual investment for reducing the impacts of climate on the developing world. Otherwise, the energy security and environmental benefits of the trilemma for Europe may be at risk. What This All Means These eight overarching issues will have a significant impact on businesses, policymakers, and developing economies. Businesses. As energy markets and polices find a new equilibrium, business continuity is vital. Companies should prepare for short-term shocks and build operational resilience to avoid major losses. These unprecedented times  One hundred million people lost access to energy because of the economic impacts of COVID-19, reversing the growth in access that had occurred during much of the past decade. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 10 necessitate robust scenario thinking to drive strategy and direction. To address uncertainty, all companies need to think through even unlikely scenarios. Firms with revenues tied to the energy and commodity value chains are facing a continued revenue boom, resulting from the combined supercycle and the likely subsidies that are fueling profit pools. But too few companies currently have the skills and foresight to allocate this capital in a fashion that sets the organization up for success while reducing the potential for political clawbacks (such as windfall taxes). Businesses must also be responsive and flexible in the face of changing regulations. Some regulators will take aggressive actions to drive the energy transition, whether through increasing use of carbon pricing or enacting tougher product standards (such as the EU’s plans to ban new ICE vehicle registrations starting in 2035). Other countries may impose import or export controls on certain goods or commodities, in which case purchasers will need to maintain flexible supply chains and sellers will need to strengthen their position in domestic markets. Policymakers. Improved energy security cannot come at the expense of the energy transition and UNFCC commitments on climate change. To arrive at a secure, decarbonized end state, policymakers must consider the ideal policy trajectories for the short, medium, and long term. This will require more government intervention, not less, to provide the frameworks and incentives necessary for energy markets to adapt. Countries should be aware of the new dependencies (such as on rare earths and nickel) created by the energy transition. To navigate this changing landscape,  These unprecedented times necessitate robust scenario thinking to drive strategy and direction. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 11 governments should undertake analyses of the geopolitical issues involved in the energy transition, assess the likely impact on national supply chains, and work with producers to diversify supplies of critical minerals. Many national and regional energy markets and policies were designed for a different era and are struggling in the face of turmoil and price spikes. Governments and regulators must consider how energy markets, particularly carbon pricing and carbon markets that connect globally, can be redesigned to take account of the new reality and deliver affordable energy for consumers while supporting the energy transition. Developing Economies. Developing countries are most affected by climate change and higher costs for food and fuel. Consequently, politicians and their constituencies are more likely to focus on the near term during times of crisis, which could slow the energy transition. Indeed, high natural gas prices will drive many developing countries out of the market, causing them to rely on coal or diesel generation in the near term. The resulting lack of sufficient energy will reduce GDP growth and increase the risk of geopolitical disruptions such as unrest, civil war, and rapid changes in state control. The $100 billion pledged under COP21 to help developing economies during the energy transition is at risk of not being invested, even though it’s needed now more than ever because of rising costs.  The energy transition could accelerate in parts of the developed world, but political leaders should be aware of the risk of blowback if costs rise sharply. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 12 The energy transition could accelerate in parts of the developed world, but political leaders should be aware of the risk of blowback if costs rise sharply, particularly if little progress is occurring with emission reduction. During this period of economic upheaval and geopolitical uncertainty, finding the right balance between energy security, affordability, and environmental sustainability is more urgent, and more challenging, than ever. Businesses and policymakers must take an active role to ensure that people everywhere have access to affordable energy while making the energy transition a reality. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 13 Authors Nikolaus Lang Managing Director & Senior Partner; Global Leader, Global Advantage Practice Munich Maurice Berns Managing Director & Senior Partner; Global Leader, Oil & Gas Sector London Anders Porsborg-Smith Managing Director & Partner Oslo Jamie Webster Partner and Associate Director, Center for Energy Impact Seattle Tim Figures Associate Director London ABOUT BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP Boston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities.

The input costs for three key metals (nickel, lithium, and cobalt) for a 60 KWh electric-vehicle battery have risen sharply, from $1,395 a year ago to $7,400 in April 2022, which could slow the uptake of EV penetration. At the same time, springtime prices for jet fuel in New York Harbor exceeded $300/b, a price so high that sustainable aviation fuel is not just competitive, it’s cheaper. And EU carbon prices have hit new highs of €100/ton, making a new range of decarbonization options more affordable. Government Investment and “Greenflation” Renewable power producers were experiencing constraints before Russia invaded Ukraine and cut off supply. Several wind OEMs had cited supply chain issues involving electrical components, balsa trees needed for blades, and general capacity constraints. Now, significant power and gas infrastructure investments are required to reorient European supply networks away from Russia and toward liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Some early signs are promising: Poland and Bulgaria have both used LNG imports from neighboring countries to offset the lack of Russian supply. But this shift will take time and money. And in the meantime, it could well lead to additional supply chain logjams and further cost inflation for critical minerals essential to renewable technologies, a phenomenon known as “greenflation.” © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 7 To spur the energy transition, governments are likely to reexamine their permitting processes to shorten the time needed to put new capacity on the market. Indeed, this is a central pillar of the recent REPowerEU initiative, which seeks to accelerate the EU’s green transition by diversifying gas supplies, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, speeding up permitting processes, and increasing energy efficiency. Greater Energy Price Volatility Volatility levels for Brent oil have risen nearly 100% since February 2022, compared with the same period in 2021. TTF natural gas price volatility is up 26% in the same period. Volatility has also spread to carbon markets. As a result, oil and gas companies are delaying investment decisions. Lowcarbon investments are at particular risk because of relatively increased sensitivity to interest rates and because access to financing is increasingly subject to contractual proof of offtake and floor prices. The long-term impact of EU energy sanctions on Russia and the broader world remains to be seen, with the bloc struggling to ramp up action because of the dependence of some of its members on Russian energy exports. Meanwhile, a ban on insuring cargos of Russian oil is being considered, in addition to measures to reduce Russia’s ability to sell its oil to other customers. Insufficient Energy Supply  Because of high price volatility, oil and gas companies are delaying investment decisions. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 8 The global energy supply was not receiving sufficient investment before the invasion. It must now be ramped up significantly to avoid price spikes. Investments to boost oil and gas production have been too low in recent years, even if peak demand has been near at hand. The growing importance of energy security and the need to bolster supply chains mandate a level of energy investment not seen since 2007. New technologies, too, have not received sufficient funding. In 2021, investments rose only modestly. So far in 2022, investments in direct air capture technology have been sporadic. Investments in other new technologies need to grow substantially if we are to meet environmental and energy security goals. About $800 million has been spent on these technologies in the first four months of 2022; in the past four years, approximately $400 million was spent. While this is an impressive level of growth, it still falls far short of the total annual investment of $3 trillion to $4 trillion needed to fund the energy transition. Developed economies are also expected to invest more in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), hydrogen, and long-duration storage. Even before the war in Ukraine, nuclear power was experiencing a renaissance, largely in the developing world. The UK has also now included significant new nuclear power, modular in nature, in its recently released British Energy Security Strategy. Given the heightened interest in a low-carbon baseload that is not tied to hydrocarbon supply, nuclear technologies, especially new ones such as small modular reactors, will likely assume a greater share of the energy mix. Inadequate Energy Access in the Developing World One hundred million people lost access to energy because of the economic impacts of COVID-19, reversing the growth in access that had occurred during much of the past decade. With higher energy prices and the challenges of importing needed materials since the invasion of Ukraine, the number of people without access to energy will grow. Europe’s lack of non-Russian sources of natural gas and greater © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 9 renewable energy capacity are helping boost prices there. These issues have already impacted the ability to pay for natural gas in countries such as Pakistan; Sri Lanka, too, is struggling with increased energy poverty. Food and fuel protests are quickly becoming a regular occurrence in many parts of the world. There is also growing anger in the developing world about inconsistent messaging: countries are being told not to develop domestic natural gas resources, while Europe is renewing its focus on building out the bloc’s resources as well as its import and transport capabilities. Given that this part of the world will be responsible for a large proportion of future emissions growth, developed countries should underwrite the agreed-to $100 billion annual investment for reducing the impacts of climate on the developing world. Otherwise, the energy security and environmental benefits of the trilemma for Europe may be at risk. What This All Means These eight overarching issues will have a significant impact on businesses, policymakers, and developing economies. Businesses. As energy markets and polices find a new equilibrium, business continuity is vital. Companies should prepare for short-term shocks and build operational resilience to avoid major losses. These unprecedented times  One hundred million people lost access to energy because of the economic impacts of COVID-19, reversing the growth in access that had occurred during much of the past decade. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 10 necessitate robust scenario thinking to drive strategy and direction. To address uncertainty, all companies need to think through even unlikely scenarios. Firms with revenues tied to the energy and commodity value chains are facing a continued revenue boom, resulting from the combined supercycle and the likely subsidies that are fueling profit pools. But too few companies currently have the skills and foresight to allocate this capital in a fashion that sets the organization up for success while reducing the potential for political clawbacks (such as windfall taxes). Businesses must also be responsive and flexible in the face of changing regulations. Some regulators will take aggressive actions to drive the energy transition, whether through increasing use of carbon pricing or enacting tougher product standards (such as the EU’s plans to ban new ICE vehicle registrations starting in 2035). Other countries may impose import or export controls on certain goods or commodities, in which case purchasers will need to maintain flexible supply chains and sellers will need to strengthen their position in domestic markets. Policymakers. Improved energy security cannot come at the expense of the energy transition and UNFCC commitments on climate change. To arrive at a secure, decarbonized end state, policymakers must consider the ideal policy trajectories for the short, medium, and long term. This will require more government intervention, not less, to provide the frameworks and incentives necessary for energy markets to adapt. Countries should be aware of the new dependencies (such as on rare earths and nickel) created by the energy transition. To navigate this changing landscape,  These unprecedented times necessitate robust scenario thinking to drive strategy and direction. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 11 governments should undertake analyses of the geopolitical issues involved in the energy transition, assess the likely impact on national supply chains, and work with producers to diversify supplies of critical minerals. Many national and regional energy markets and policies were designed for a different era and are struggling in the face of turmoil and price spikes. Governments and regulators must consider how energy markets, particularly carbon pricing and carbon markets that connect globally, can be redesigned to take account of the new reality and deliver affordable energy for consumers while supporting the energy transition. Developing Economies. Developing countries are most affected by climate change and higher costs for food and fuel. Consequently, politicians and their constituencies are more likely to focus on the near term during times of crisis, which could slow the energy transition. Indeed, high natural gas prices will drive many developing countries out of the market, causing them to rely on coal or diesel generation in the near term. The resulting lack of sufficient energy will reduce GDP growth and increase the risk of geopolitical disruptions such as unrest, civil war, and rapid changes in state control. The $100 billion pledged under COP21 to help developing economies during the energy transition is at risk of not being invested, even though it’s needed now more than ever because of rising costs.  The energy transition could accelerate in parts of the developed world, but political leaders should be aware of the risk of blowback if costs rise sharply. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 12 The energy transition could accelerate in parts of the developed world, but political leaders should be aware of the risk of blowback if costs rise sharply, particularly if little progress is occurring with emission reduction. During this period of economic upheaval and geopolitical uncertainty, finding the right balance between energy security, affordability, and environmental sustainability is more urgent, and more challenging, than ever. Businesses and policymakers must take an active role to ensure that people everywhere have access to affordable energy while making the energy transition a reality. © 2022 Boston Consulting Group 13 Authors Nikolaus Lang Managing Director & Senior Partner; Global Leader, Global Advantage Practice Munich Maurice Berns Managing Director & Senior Partner; Global Leader, Oil & Gas Sector London Anders Porsborg-Smith Managing Director & Partner Oslo Jamie Webster Partner and Associate Director, Center for Energy Impact Seattle Tim Figures Associate Director London ABOUT BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP Boston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities.

      "﻿Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix Thousands of megawatts of renewable resources—chiefly wind and solar—are in the works. What types of grid services can these provide as electricity markets and policies evolve? Evan Polymeneas, Humayun Tai, and Amy Wagner OCTOBER 2018 • ELECTRIC POWER & NATURAL GAS © DBP/Getty Images 2 Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix Renewables such as wind and solar now account for the majority share of new electricity generation capacity being built globally. Though still dwarfed in the generating fleet by more traditional generation options such as coal, gas, and nuclear power, intermittent resources have risen dramatically, first aided by supportive policies, technology advances, and consumer preferences but now driven more by economics.1 This has resulted in a growth of the contribution of renewable generation in the United States. As year-end 2017, approximately 17 percent of electricity in the United States was generated by renewables (including hydropower). Through March 2018, renewables accounted for about 21 percent of all electric generating capacity.2 The European Union is even farther ahead of the United States: in 2017, approximately 30 percent of the EU’s electricity was generated by renewable energy sources.3 The rise of renewables is expected to continue, at least for the next few years. Policy makers in the European Union have set high and aspirational decarbonization goals: by 2030, cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 40 percent compared to a 1990 baseline.4 Germany’s coalition government agreement5 set a new 65 percent target for renewable penetration by 2030. France is aiming for a 40 percent share of renewables in electricity production.6 In the United States, despite the announced withdrawal from the Paris accord, some states are implementing their own renewable-energy policies: California,7 New Jersey, and New York have required utilities under their jurisdiction to have 50 percent of their electricity come from renewable resources by 2030, while Massachusetts recently enacted a 35 percent renewable portfolio standard. Many utilities in the United States are replacing coal capacity with a mix of renewables plus, in many occasions, energy storage. Other drivers abound. On both sides of the Atlantic, some customers—ranging from Fortune 500 companies to individual homeowners—are scrutinizing their electricity options with an eye to lowering their carbon footprints and greening their supply chains. A growing pool of investment capital is backing “clean” or “green” electricity options. This is partly a play toward diversification, but renewable generation also represents many of the characteristics of the stable returns pension funds and other institutional capital seek. Their long horizon and low cost of capital is part of the overall reduction in the final cost to consumers seen in recent responses to requests for proposals for electric generation. Renewable electric prices fall while challenges rise Beyond policy goals, the growth of renewables is supported by their improving cost outlook. According to Lazard’s year-end 2017 estimate, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for utility-scale renewable electricity continue to fall, averaging $45 per megawatt-hour (MWh) for unsubsidized wind power and $45 to $50 per MWh for utilityscale solar, compared to approximately $60 per MWh for combined-cycle natural gas.8 In several geographies, solar and wind are already competitive with other sources of generation based on LCOE, even without tax or production subsidies. In LCOE terms, these resources are expected to be the cheapest source of electricity within the next decade. However, LCOE metrics ignore one important consideration. Renewable generation is intermittent and frequently unpredictable. Furthermore, the uneven geographic distribution of wind and solar potential is likely to stress the grid in some locations, leading to transmission and distribution constraints. These low-cost, renewable kilowatt-hours come with intermittency, volatility, and grid-integration costs, creating new grid-planning requirements for backup capacity and ramping. New types of Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix 3 services and thus a differentiated set of market products and customer programs will likely deliver a lower cost solution. Operating electric grids with high penetration of intermittent resources poses unique challenges for utilities and grid operators. While not limited to California, that state’s much discussed “duck curve” (Exhibit 1) illustrates one of the difficulties managing a grid with a high percentage of renewable generation, which sometimes is dispatched at zero or even negative variable cost, resulting in displacement of other resources which may be needed to manage flexibility. Though this particular iteration of the “duck curve” is a projection, it differs little from recent years’ operational facts. During the hours of a spring day when the sun is shining most brightly, that is, from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., renewable generation surges, displacing other forms of electric generation. The problem is most acute in the first and second quarters of a year. During the first quarter of 2017, the price of generation on the CAISO fell to zero or less than zero for as much as 15 percent of the time between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.9 As solar generation peaks mid-day, non-solar generation is ramped down. More importantly, later in the day those ramped-down plants will need to ramp up as solar output declines. The significant amount of renewable output during the mid-day solar peak means that nonrenewable-generation plants will have to operate close or at their minimum generation levels and possibly shut down for several hours each day, stressing equipment as well as operating economics. For wind-based systems, the need for flexibility might manifest in different ways. For example, significant investments might be needed to alleviate power-export constraints from zones with significant wind potential to major load centers, an effect that has already been observed in Texas’s Panhandle Renewable Energy Zone. Additionally, electricity services, beyond the traditional energy and four-to-six-hour capacity requirements, can be fostered to manage these intrinsic characteristics of clean-generation technologies. Those services are flexibility and resiliency. Some electricity markets, such as the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), Germany, and the United Kingdom, have started to recognize, to varying degrees, flexible, and resilient electric resources. And policy makers at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the PJM Interconnection are shifting focus, in the United States at least, to the role that battery energy storage and flexible resources like distributed resource aggregators (DRA) could play as electricity markets evolve. We believe significant steps can be taken toward decarbonizing the electricity supply through thoughtful, concerted action, as we discuss below. High renewable penetration can cause several issues in the operation of the grid that can vary by geography, depending on, among other things, the mix of renewable-energy sources (solar versus wind), the availability of transmission and distribution (T&D) capacity, the fleet of nonrenewable generating stations, and the shape of electricity demand. There is no universal, one-size-fits-all solution to integrating ever-greater amounts of renewable generation into the grid. What works in Philadelphia may not work in Portland or Phoenix. Heading off current and future challenges is not simply a matter of tinkering at the margins with market rules or mandating a set level of electricitystorage projects. Holistic solutions that encompass supply, demand, regulation, and market structure are needed. Storage could be part of the solution, as could supply-side resources, customer programs, and regulatory leadership. The solutions could also recognize that different resources provide different 4 United States, some regulatory bodies are taking important preliminary steps, which we also discuss below, to more effectively and economically add more intermittent resources to the electricity mix. First, we will examine some of the new resources that are creating value in this variable operating environment. Then, we will identify barriers prohibiting the full realization of their potential. Finally, we will conclude with solutions that electric-power stakeholders could consider. Enter the age of new resources New challenges require new thinking. The market has a set of traditional options for responding to the rampdown of intermittent resources, but in a decarbonized future, those traditional options are increasingly misaligned with overarching policy goals. For example, one traditional response to falling output from intermittent generation is to ramp night-time wind-overgeneration issues might arise, an effect already apparent in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and Southwest Power Pool. Furthermore, short-term wind-forecasting errors might hamper the grid operator’s ability to match supply and demand, degrading the system’s primary and secondary frequency response, as has already been observed in several European markets. This creates a series of far-ranging consequences. The operational and planning challenges caused by the intermittency, volatility, and uneven placement of these intermittent resources are becoming more significant and, likely, costlier. The United States is neither alone nor the first country to be forced to tackle the challenge of integrating ever-greater amount of renewable generation into the grid. European markets have implemented some measures that bear consideration by US regulators, which we discuss below. In the Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix Exhibit 1 Source: California Independent System Operator (CAISO); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; McKinsey analysis Load and generation during typical spring day in California, GW per hour Actual vs forecast net load During the hours when the sun is shining most brightly, renewable generation surges, displacing other forms of electric generation. 0 Downward ramping Upward ramping Evening peak FORECAST NET LOAD NET LOAD ACTUAL NET LOAD RENEWABLE SURGE Minimum load and overgeneration 00:00 06:00 12:00 18:00 24:00 21:00 21:15 21:30 21:45 22:00 10 20 30 40 50 Demand response is expected to address several issues associated with high renewable penetration. 5 a combined-cycle gas turbine generator as well as some traditional demand-side options. Today, at prices of $320 to $410 per installed kilowatt-hour for a five-hour lithium-ion battery, energy storage is currently significantly more expensive than curtailing renewables. However, with projected cost declines in the approximately 70 percent range by 2030, lithium-ion battery storage has the potential to be a competitive option for avoiding curtailments through time shifting. The role of storage already is being recognized by policy makers in jurisdictions with high up gas-fired generators. But that practice comes with a cost—to customers and to the policy goal of decarbonizing. Enter battery-energy storage and DRAs. As Exhibit 2 shows, there are two categories of options for the intraday shifting type of flexibility service that could be competitive against the traditional options: battery energy storage and distributed resource aggregation. Exhibit 2 shows storage options in the not-toodistant future could compare favorably with traditional supply-side options like constructing Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix Exhibit 2 1 Represents the cost of curtailing renewable generation during overgeneration periods and procuring additional MWh at the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of a new combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant during peak period.

We see a future where DRAs operate in energy and capacity markets in regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs). As customer charges evolve to include the cost of flexibility, a new class of services emerges for energy assets that can respond at the right time and the right location in the grid. The role of the customer also is evolving as large commercial and industrial enterprises explore ways to use their energy assets beyond offsetting volumetric charges and toward providing grid-flexibility services. As shown in Exhibit 2 automated control of customer load, inclusive of customer incentives and customer acquisition, can be a cost-competitive source of loadshifting flexibility even today, frequently cheaper than the generation alternative. The evolution of technology and provider business models is finally facilitating this new role for distributed resources. The proliferation of smart meters is providing utilities and providers with access to customer data and enabling seamless measurement and verification of the customer demand-side response to grid-operator needs. Providers such as Ecofactor, OhmConnect, and Stem can now more easily acquire and onboard customers to demand-side aggregation programs, addressing one of the industry’s perennial hurdles: high customer-acquisition costs. Advances in digital tools for customer engagement and targeting will only further facilitate this trend. Regulators are also adjusting to enable DRAs more meaningfully. Reforming the Energy Vision in New York has explicitly stated a goal of increased customer and third-party participation penetration of renewable generation. Following the California Public Utility Commission’s 1.3 gigawatt (GW) storage target in 2013 (supplemented with an additional 0.5 GW target in 201710), several states set aggressive storage goals: Massachusetts has a 200 MW target by 2020, New Jersey recently announced a 600 MW goal by 2021 (and 2,000 MW by 2030), and New York has defined a road map to 1,500 MW by 2025. Responses to recent requests for proposal for renewable projects often come bundled with storage. Even conventional generation is looking at co-located storage to optimize dispatch to improve economics and performance of traditional natural gas, coal, and nuclear units. Battery storage is new and interesting for the same reason other advanced technologies driving change in the electricity business—cloud computing, big data analytics, and two-way digital meters—are exciting: they uncover new value-creation opportunities. Value stacking, the ability to combine multiple use cases for storage, is beginning to pencil out. Storage is being used to defer investments in the T&D systems of some utilities. Storage also can be used to get around system constraints: battery-storage projects kept the lights on in Southern California when the Aliso Canyon gas-storage facility was closed. Distributed energy resources (DERs) have made their mark on utility integrated resource plans (IRPs). Coming right behind DERs are DRAs, an emerging resource category too-often overlooked in the United States. Aggregation pilots are taking place across the country, with companies like Stem and Advanced Microgrid Solutions working on DER aggregation projects. Distributed-energy-resource management systems (DERMS) are being adopted from leading utilities across the world, as tools to monitor, oversee, and even help control DERs offering services to the grid. As the landscape of DERMS providers matures, the capabilities of these systems will extend to active, real-time dispatch and measurement of DER assets, further facilitating the role of DRAs. Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix 7 Of course, not all of this technical potential will be realized, limited by customers’ willingness to participate in aggregation programs. According to a survey of 400 customers familiar with demand response and aggregation concepts, 30 to 50 percent of commercial and industrial customers exhibit interest in participating as part of a broader aggregated portfolio of resources in energy markets, while 35 to 60 percent of owners of DER assets have expressed interest in participating in a capacity-aggregation program. If we adjust the 240 GW of technical potential for approximately 30 percent participation, a total of nearly 70 GW of flexible capacity, equivalent to approximately 7 percent of US electricity demand, could be available to address the grid’s flexibility needs. in energy markets and has created the foundation of a distributed system platform to support this goal. In the United Kingdom, the National Grid’s Power Responsive Initiative has set an objective of increased participation of new flexible resources, such as DERs and storage. We expect the potential of distributed resources to support the grid will be significant. Exhibit 3 shows the cumulative potential to provide short-term flexibility services by type of resource. A total of 145 GW of technical potential are available today, and an additional 95 GW can become available by 2030 as DER-adoption scales and market rules for DRAs improve, for a total of 240 GW. Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix Exhibit 3 1 Potential not actual capacity numbers. Actual adoption of distributed exible resources is lower than the potential. 2017 numbers are: ~9.2 GW of distributed resources (DR) in PJM (2017 delivery year), 0.85 GW in ERCOT (2017 essential-reliability-services demand response), 1.5 GW in CAISO (2017 estimate of dispatchable DR resources, including the demand-response-auction-mechanism program), 0.6 GW in MISO (2017 estimate of demand-response-resource (DRR) type I and DRR type II), 0.35 GW in ISO New England (includes only actively dispatched resources and not passive energy efciency in the OnPeak program) and an estimated 8.0–12.0 GW in non-ISO regions. 2 Assumes that rules favorable to distributed resource aggregation are instituted: no minimum size requirements, no minimum dispatch duration, no limits to the type of resource. 3 Potential today is limited by the types of resources that can participate (eg, minimum size, duration for which each resource needs to dispatch, telemetry and measurement requirements).

The policy framework is often disjointed, particularly when distribution assets provide wholesale-market services. The ability of these resources to create value is dampened by legacy rules, including the divergence and lack of integration between distribution and transmission markets. Furthermore, the metering, telemetry, and control standards for distributed resources participating in wholesale markets have not been seamlessly defined. The paradigm of the distribution-system operator, frequently ascribed to electric utilities in the United States, has not yet evolved to seamlessly price, measure, verify, and manage electricity services from distributed assets. These operational “seams” issues require changes not only at the market and transmission-operator level but also often within distribution utilities themselves. With the wide range of capabilities and software, it may take a while for demand-side resources to be full participants in electric markets. Update legacy market-participation models and dispatch rules Rules for participation in wholesale markets have not matured to allow a more expansive set of market participants beyond traditional generating plants. For example, market models and participating rules are not currently accounting for the physical characteristics of energy storage, such as its need to maintain adequate charge and discharge and its ability to potentially “stack” multiple types of products (for example, capacity and frequency regulation). Furthermore, by guaranteeing “out of market” payments, such as in the case of “make-whole” payments for curtailments of renewable generation, market rules are in many occasions not exposing Action to consider in four critical areas As technological improvements and the new operational realities of a renewables-based electricity mix create opportunities for new types of resources, it is important that market designers, market participants, and policy makers take part fully in the market’s evolution. Here are four clusters of issues we believe could be addressed so that storage and DRAs can play their appropriate roles in a low-cost, lower-carbon electricity business. Create new services to meet new realities As energy-imbalance issues manifested in European markets with high renewables penetration (for example, Germany and the United Kingdom), these providers have grown beyond the traditional demand-response-provider model to offer new flexibility services. For example, in Europe, electricity markets in Germany and Belgium recognize the ability of independent market actors known as balancing responsible parties (BRPs) and balancing service providers (BSPs) to submit aggregated energy schedules and balancing services from a set of aggregated resources under their control. This has given rise to what is referred to as “virtual power plants,” which are in the forefront of the flexibility landscape. Through this construct, providers such as NextKraftwerke (over four GW in managed load) have been able to balance the intermittency of large-scale renewables that they manage with the flexibility of distributed energy assets (such as onsite generation) and load resources (such as large commercial and industrial facilities). However, this requires sophisticated software, bidding, and verification programs. In the United States, it would also require a significant amount of regulatory and market transformation to enable full participation. Improve integration at the T&D interface There is insufficient regulatory clarity regarding the oversight of resources connected to the Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix 9 develop unique market services that identify and monetize their contribution to grid reliability. Storage and demand-side resources could potentially strike a compromise in obtaining access to energy and flexibility services by supporting, rather than fighting, some of the conventional players. Steps market participants could consider Here are potential solutions that market stakeholders can explore to speed the transition to a lower-carbon electricity industry. For utility decision makers  Expand the scope of the grid-planning process to consider nonwire alternatives to grid-capacity expansion. T&D planning in the future should consider both utility-owned plants, including utility-owned storage, as well as competitive solicitations of third-party aggregated distributed resources.  Evolve the utility model into a platform for grid products and services. The value of the distribution grid will be enhanced when it acts as the access point for a landscape of distributed resource aggregators providing services to the transmission grid. Regulated distribution utilities could offer a layer of measurement and verification, customer acquisition, and DER management services to third-party providers—leveraging their extensive smart meter, communications, IT infrastructure, and operational-technology infrastructure.  Redesign utility information and operations technology with an eye toward integrating millions of distributed resources through distributed-energy-resource management systems (DERMS). These systems should be able to track, monitor, and facilitate the control and management of DERs, providing essential grid-balancing services. DERMS should also inflexible resources to their true market risk. On top of that, market operators have been reluctant to explore innovative market designs, such as loadshifting and ramping services. However, there are early indications that markets are responding. FERC has already approved Order 841, mandating that market rules evolve to accommodate the characteristics of energy storage assets and that market mechanisms evolve to allow storage to more fully participate. In an effort to prepare for California’s high renewable future, CAISO is already experimenting with a load-shifting product and has already instituted payments for a flexible ramping product. The regulatory framework is starting to be created, though different organizations are proceeding at different speeds. Recognize separate roles for flexibility services and resiliency “Resiliency” has been a topic of much discussion in the electricity business over the past year. As yet, there is no accepted definition of resiliency, though steps are being taken to define this elusive term. It is worth noting that while storage and demandside resources are working to change the rules and allow for their fuller participation in energy and intraday capacity markets, they also should recognize importance of security and backup. Distributed resources potentially contribute to grid resiliency by providing localized backup during grid outages and emergencies. Nevertheless, there could still be a unique role for conventional resources in providing grid resiliency and backup that these new resources might be unable to offer. Aggregated distributed resources and storage are resources that ultimately shift energy and can help a grid operator better manage daily capacity needs and peaks. However, those resources cannot deliver multiday or seasonal capacity. Resources that back up the renewables on the system will need to also Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix 10  Invest in automation. Automatic monitoring, market participation, and dispatch of diverse asset types, ranging from front of the meter to behind the meter, are necessary elements for a winning strategy as this new landscape emerges.  Recognize the value of diverse resources. Renewable developers should advocate for large interconnected markets and should support resiliency and reliability payments to the backup generation necessary to maintain the performance expectations of customers. For policy makers Policy makers are pushing the boundaries of existing policy and frameworks to deal with these challenges. In a number of geographies, there are new ideas being developed, including the enactment of rules favoring aggregated resource participation in market constructs consisting of combined transmission-level and distribution-level assets. For example, recent PJM rules favoring participation of intermittent and seasonal resources as aggregate capacity resources in the PJM’s 2020 to 2021 capacity auction are opening up that market to a wider set of resources. European markets are a step ahead of this, with their emphasis on BRPs and BSPs. FERC has signaled its intent to move in a similar direction, with its notice of proposed rule-making on DER aggregation. This development is slated to allow DER aggregation to participate in ISO and RTO markets and to remove barriers for distributed resource aggregation. Regulators are also creating new markets for flexibility services. As the cost component associated with flexibility increases, regulators could increasingly consider instituting market mechanisms that will minimize out-of-market payments and will increasingly enable third-partyprovider access. There are several types of new flexibility services that are being introduced: be integrated with critical utility processes, such as distribution management systems and grid planning.  Innovate in rate design. Utilities and their regulators should explore more flexible and cost-reflective rate-design options, encouraging customers to shift consumption toward times of the day when renewable energy is abundant and enabling owners of distributed energy resources to enhance the value of their assets by responding to grid needs. Time-varying rates (such as the California solar time-of-use policy,11 enacted in 2017) and locational DER rates (such as the Value of DER rule in New York, announced in 2017) are steps in that direction. For market participants  Rethink power purchase agreements (PPAs) and risk allocation. Renewable-energy providers need to face increasing market risk, such as more mandated curtailments or negative prices. As long-term PPA contracts become less common, the management of long-term risk allocation between the developer and the power purchaser increases in importance.  Create hybrids. Providers might increasingly see value in balancing their renewable-energy projects with flexible assets such as energy storage or demand-side aggregations. Synergies in equipment siting and permitting as well as engineering and procurement costs could drive significant value in renewables and storage projects.  Prepare for increased volatility. The value associated with sophisticated trading operations has seen a decline as price volatility flattened. In high-renewable environments, a period of high volatility is upcoming. As market participants face new types of risks, understanding electricity markets and managing price risk are likely to represent new opportunities. Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix 11 and generation-related services, existing regulatory frameworks are likely to face new challenges. State regulators and federal authorities are likely to find themselves jointly regulating assets that can “stack” multiple sources of value across the value chain. Policy makers are pressed to consider rules that govern the interface between transmission-system and distribution-system markets. Laying the foundations for a lower-carbon future In ten years, we expect that market participants— and customers—will look back and see the current turbulent but exciting time of industry transformation as forming the critical foundations for a dramatically different, lower-carbon, more efficient, and highly decentralized electricity business. The framework that will emerge from today’s discussions could shape the industry’s future as dramatically as the Federal Power Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, or the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Load-shifting services that give incentives for moving demand to periods when renewableenergy sources are abundant. The load-shifting service under development by CAISO is an example. This concept already has been investigated in Europe (for instance, through the Demand Turn Up market in the United Kingdom).  Primary-frequency-control products that offer incentives for the participation of fast-response assets that can balance the grid with response times lower than five seconds. These include the Fast Frequency Response and the Enhanced Frequency Response markets in the United Kingdom and the primary-frequency-control reserve markets in Belgium and Germany, all of which allow demand-side participation.  Secondary and tertiary control products that balance longer-term fluctuations relating to forecast errors in wind and solar resources, such as the ones frequently exhibited in high-wind environments.  Separate markets for resiliency and reliability services that cover system-backup and resiliency needs.  Evolution of rigid renewable-portfolio standards to integrated-resource-planning (IRP) approaches that account for the total cost of a resource portfolio and assign procurement targets for renewable assets as well as associated investments that will enable them. Frequently, a balanced mix of resources (for example, wind and solar) lead to reduced flexibility needs. As renewable targets increase, the reliability and resiliency impacts should also be co-optimized in an IRP process.  Rules that accommodate assets that cut cross the electric-power value chain: as storage and DER aggregations can offer distribution Less carbon means more flexibility: Recognizing the rise of new resources in the electricity mix 1 “Nearly half of utility-scale capacity installed in 2017 came from renewables,” U.S. Energy Information Administration, January 10, 2018, eia.gov.

Kleine, and Andreas Schlosser May 2019 Renewable energy is the future—for industry, for the environment, and for society as a whole. It is high on the global agenda and crucial to meeting the world’s carbon-reduction goals. Moreover, renewable technologies are not just clean, they are fast becoming the cheapest form of power generation in many markets. However, renewable energy is only one piece of the puzzle. Other pieces include the reengineering of infrastructure to create a smart grid, the electrification of entire industries, and the introduction of e-mobility across the transport sector. Meanwhile, digitization, the emergence of smart devices, and the smart grid are opening up possibilities for consumers to gain direct access to the market. For instance, households equipped with solar photovoltaic cells can feed any surplus electricity they generate into the grid, thereby acting as both producers and consumers (or “prosumers,” as they have been dubbed) of energy. Other households are using smart meters to adjust their consumption in line with current market price or the time of day, another example of smart demand and supply management. Energy and technology companies have naturally been preparing for these developments for some time. But what about businesses in other industries—businesses that have both means and social responsibilities? More specifically, what role could financial institutions play in the energy transition and the emerging energy landscape? This article sets out to provide preliminary answers to that question. Although it focuses mainly on Europe, many of the opportunities discussed are applicable in other regions too. To set the context, we identify the global trends shaping energy markets, then we examine six promising areas of opportunity for financial institutions to explore. How is the energy landscape developing? Today’s energy industry is in transition, being shaped by a set of powerful global trends. Growth in global energy demand is slowing As living standards in developed Western economies rose dramatically between 1950 and 2000, global energy demand increased by a compound annual growth rate of almost 3 percent a year. Between 2000 and 2015, demand continued to grow at more than 2 percent a year, with much of the growth fueled by rapid industrialization in China. However, this growth rate is expected to halve (to less than 1 percent a year) over the next 15 years and halve again (to 0.5 percent a year) between 2030 and 2050.1 As demand growth slows, predicting demand will become more difficult. The centuries-long link among industrial advances, higher energy consumption, and GDP growth is breaking down. Environmental concerns and commercial imperatives have helped spur the development of innovative technologies for non-carbon-emitting power generation and drive massive improvements in energy efficiency. Load factors2 and fuel efficiency have more than doubled since the beginning of this century. Demand for electricity will grow seven times faster than for other energy sources Perhaps the single biggest argument for the importance of renewable energy is that, for the foreseeable future, demand will grow far more quickly for electricity than for any other energy source. The growth rate for electricity already exceeds those for oil, gas, and coal, and by 2050, it is expected to be seven times higher than the average for other fuels (Exhibit 1). 1 IEA energy balances (historical); Vaclav Smil, Energy Transitions: History, Requirements, Prospects, Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 2010; “Global energy perspective,” Energy Insights by McKinsey, December 2017. 2A load factor is defined as the average demand during one period divided by peak demand in that period. It is a way of assessing the steadiness of electricity consumption over a specific period. Generators prefer a higher load factor because it increases predictability. 2 Fueling the energy transition: Opportunities for financial institutions The primary driver of this growth is the electrification of the construction, transport, and industrial sectors. Oil-, diesel-, and gas-fired power generation is being gradually replaced by renewable-based power generation. In addition, as industries digitize, they experience a massive rise in data flows, data processing, data storage, and server capacity, increasing their power requirements and contributing to the widening gap between demand for electricity and demand for other fuel sources. Renewables are becoming cheaper than fossil fuels One of the biggest drawbacks of renewable energy used to be its generation cost. Solar and wind energy could not be generated at utility scale without government support. However, the costs of both solar and wind energy are now below the cost of traditional fuels, and they are likely to fall further over the next decade, giving renewables an even bigger cost advantage. In the United Kingdom, for example, newly constructed onshore-wind power generation is already cheaper than existing gas and coal capacity, for which the only cost is fuel. Costs of new offshore-wind and new solar-photovoltaic power generation will follow suit by 2030. Germany has already reached this point for all renewable technologies, and other countries in Europe and beyond are on a similar trajectory (Exhibit 2). Thanks to these economics, solar and wind power generation will grow five to ten times faster than any other power-generation technology will in the next few years.

In response, incumbents are reorienting themselves, with the German energy giants making particularly radical moves. E.ON and RWE have split their companies into two entities: traditional energy generation and future energy system (grid, renewable, and customers). Then both companies went a step further. RWE brought together its traditional- and renewable-generation groups, while E.ON integrated its grid and customer businesses to focus on the parts of the value chain beyond energy generation. Other incumbent energy companies, such as Denmark’s Ørsted, Italy’s Enel, and Spain’s Iberdrola, shifted their investment focus toward renewable energy resources at an early stage. Demand and supply management and storage are increasingly being used to handle variability A major limitation of renewable energy is its Exhibit 2 Insights 2019 Fueling the energy transition: Opportunities for financial institutions Exhibit 2 of 4 1 Fuel price for oil equivalent €19.6 per megawatt-hour thermal. 2Fuel price for gas equivalent €25.9 per megawatt-hour thermal. 3Fuel price for coal equivalent €10.9 megawatt-hour thermal. 4Fuel price in uranium gas equivalent €3.7 per megawatt-hour thermal.

As the energy generated by renewables cannot usually be stored easily, the energy producers have little or no control over intermittency. intermittency3: wind and sunshine are not under producers’ control. The inevitable variability in generation must be tackled indirectly either through industrial, commercial, and residential demand and supply management or through radically improved storage. One option is to repurpose electric-vehicle batteries for second lives as storage devices, for instance. Developments like this will support the emergence of a much more decentralized energy system with local small-scale generation that will complement today’s largely centralized energy system. Coal and oil will peak in the next two decades, while gas will grow moderately The much-predicted death of fossil fuels is still some way off, especially outside Europe. Coal, gas, and oil will remain part of the fuel-supply mix for the foreseeable future, especially given the appetite for energy in developing economies in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Coal and oil are expected to peak within the next 20 years, while natural gas will grow moderately. Current levels of oil production will not meet expected demand over the next 15 years. A McKinsey analysis shows that significant new production can be anticipated, even if the expected deviation from the two-degree-Celsius pathway triggers a carbon tax as high as $90 per barrel. Carbon-dioxide emissions will plateau by 2030 but remain well beyond the desired two-degreeCelsius pathway The historic Paris Agreement calls for a significant reduction in carbon emissions to hold global warming at no more than two degrees Celsius. In McKinsey’s reference-case estimate, carbon emissions will plateau by 2030, but they will remain considerably higher than the level needed to meet the target two-degree-Celsius pathway (Exhibit 3). This increases the likelihood of more drastic political interventions triggered by deepening public awareness of environmental threats, as well as commercial interventions driven by economic considerations. A prime example is China’s political turnaround to promote e-mobility, the use of renewables, and the closure of inefficient energy-intensive production sites to combat harmful urban pollution.

Reductions in countries that are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will be offset by increases from developing countries as they industrialize. The net effect will be a continuing rise in the use of oil, coal, and gas in power production and transport globally. How can financial institutions participate in energy markets? With renewables’ high capital intensity, they are fueled by finance. In fact, the cost of capital is one of the biggest drivers of electricity costs. To be economic, the generation and distribution of renewable energy require very low costs coupled with high volumes. Our experience in the industry indicates that many energy companies—more than two-thirds of the sample we canvased—are interested in doing business with financial institutions that have specialist knowledge of the energy sector. Moreover, evidence suggests these companies are not wholly satisfied with the services they receive from their current financial providers. This presents opportunities for other institutions to compete through targeted offerings. We have identified six areas for financial institutions to consider if they wish to play an active role in the energy transition. Explore renewables opportunities in Europe Europe has been a hub for renewable energy from the early days. Modern wind energy was born in Denmark, home of Vestas, the world’s largest wind-turbine manufacturer. Solar energy took off following Germany’s Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2000. Renewables are central to the strategy of Europe’s largest energy companies, including Denmark’s Ørsted, Germany’s RWE, Norway’s Equinor, Portugal’s EDP Energias de Portugal, Spain’s Iberdrola, and Sweden’s Vattenfall. Yet despite the presence of so many powerful energy companies, strong financial business partners are relatively scarce. A few financial investors, among them Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Global Infrastructure Partners, and Macquarie Capital, are financing large capitalinfrastructure investments. Other investors— including asset managers such as Allianz Global Investors and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, as well as a number of pension funds—are offering funding for corporate bonds or equity stakes in pursuit of more regulated returns. Finance the renewables revolution From 2018 to 2025, about 40 percent of annual global energy investments will go to renewables (Exhibit 4).4 This translates into an investment of almost €300 billion—almost three times the investment in fossil-fuel generation. Another 40 percent of investments will be used to develop transmission, distribution, and storage infrastructure, and 6 percent will be spent on nuclear generation. In Europe, most of the renewables investment will take place in France, Germany, Nordic countries, and the United Kingdom. The projects will be a mix of regulated and subsidy-free capacity in which generators are exposed to merchant price risk.5 To make a successful transition to an industry with high financing needs and routine exposure to wholesale markets, the renewables sector will require financial expertise to complement its deep knowledge of the energy industry. Financial institutions seeking to provide this expertise should first define a business strategy that plays to their strengths, such as capitalizing on their competitive capital-cost advantage over traditional energy companies. They will also need to boost their capabilities—for instance, by building 4World energy outlook 2018, IEA, November 2018, iea.org. 5For more, see Sven Heiligtag, Florian Kühn, Florian Küster, and Joscha Schabram, “Merchant risk management: The new frontier in renewables,” November 2018, McKinsey.com. 6 Fueling the energy transition: Opportunities for financial institutions infrastructure, connect the grid to local renewablepower-generation resources, introduce a smart grid to accommodate small-scale residential and commercial energy generation, and develop an electric-vehicle-charging infrastructure, among other things. The network of the future will allow a two-way flow of power to and from customers who are self-sufficient in power most of the time but take electricity from the grid when they need it. All these changes will disrupt the energy industry’s traditional business models and present attractive opportunities for investors. Large European energy companies will continue to be a driving force in the transition, but projects will need financing whether they receive subsidies or not. Help incumbent utilities to restructure and transform Several European utilities, including Alpiq, E.ON, RWE, and Vattenfall, have restructured their portfolios to separate their businesses into traditional and new energy. The March 2018 asset swap among RWE, E.ON, and innogy is indicative of the changes under way. The deal enables RWE to intensify its focus on generation and become Europe’s third-largest renewables company, with more than 60 percent of the region’s capacity for low-carbon generation. E.ON, meanwhile, is acquiring RWE’s majority stake in its renewableenergy subsidiary innogy and shifting its profile toward the grid and customer solutions to meet the need for specialized downstream energy providers with the scale and efficiency to drive much-needed innovation.6 As more companies follow these examples and restructure, a number of partnership opportunities are likely to open up for financial institutions. Advise on consolidation and divestment in the power market After a dormant period, M&A activity in the energy sector has picked up considerably. Exhibit 4 Estimated average annual power-sector investments globally,1 € billion,2 2018–25 Fueling the energy transition: Opportunities for financial institutions Exhibit 4 of 4 Renewables will represent 40 percent of average annual global energy investments to 2025.

In addition, they will need to ensure they have state-of-the-art tools and resources in areas such as long-term merchant-risk management. Support the infrastructure of the future Investing in infrastructure is as crucial as investing in generation capacity. Through 2025, infrastructure investments in Europe will reach €290 billion. Large investments are required to reinforce or replace grid 6 Tobias Buck and Arash Massoudi, “Eon to acquire innogy in €43bn deal with RWE,” Financial Times, March 10, 2018, ft.com. Fueling the energy transition: Opportunities for financial institutions 7 The restructuring underway involves not only consolidation among European companies but also strategic M&A deals by Chinese corporations and financial M&As by more aggressive financialsector investors, such as Australia’s Macquarie and Canada’s OMERS Infrastructure Management. All this activity creates a need for financial advisers with knowledge of the energy sector. When RWE carved out innogy, for instance, financial institutions acted in an advisory role in what was the largest IPO in Germany for more than 15 years. The deal allowed RWE to separate its growth business from its legacy operations and create two entities with distinct portfolios and a clear strategic focus. RWE also gained more flexibility in dealing with funding needs, since it could use its shareholding in innogy as a liquid asset. Further value was unlocked through the separation of innogy from RWE’s nuclear line of business, which carries unknown future liabilities because of the German government’s requirement for the company to decommission nuclear power plants at its own cost. Share in the growth of energy companies and financial sponsors As energy companies—and especially renewables players, such as EDP Energias de Portugal, Enel, Iberdrola, Ørsted, and RWE—expand their global footprints, they offer a range of opportunities for major partnerships. Financial sponsors are playing an increasingly important role as balance-sheet owners of renewables assets, holding ownership of half of the M&A deals in the energy industry between 2015 and 2017 and more than two-thirds of the onshore-wind projects in 2017. Financial institutions can provide capital at a lower cost, and they find the returns from energy projects more attractive than those from traditional alternatives, such as government bonds. But to capture the opportunities, they must be willing to enter unknown territory and take the time to understand it. That will involve building capabilities, infrastructure, and governance to support their activities in the energy industry, as well as developing the analytic skills and insight to identify opportunities as they emerge. A successful energy transition requires expertise on the financial side as well as the industrial side. Such expertise is best developed not in isolation but through partnerships. Strong partnerships are based on trust, which grows with success and over time. The question for financial institutions is simple: Do we want to be a part of this new world?

      "﻿October 2022 © Desmon Jiag/Getty Images Electric Power & Natural Gas Practice Renewable-energy development in a net-zero world Global decarbonization will require a massive build-out of wind and solar farms. But can developers find enough land, secure the supply chain, and recruit workers while maintaining profitability? This article is a collaborative effort by Florian Heineke, Nadine Janecke, Holger Klärner, Florian Kühn, Humayun Tai, and Raffael Winter, representing views from McKinsey’s Electric Power & Natural Gas Practice. The rapid maturation of wind and solar power has been nothing short of astonishing. Not long ago, the development of new solar and wind farms was typically driven by small regional players, and the cost was significantly higher than that of a coal plant. Today, the cost of renewables has plummeted, and many solar and wind projects are undertaken by large multinational companies, which often also announce staggering development targets. Over the past decade, the growth of renewable energy has consistently and dramatically outperformed nearly all expectations (Exhibit 1). Upward corrections of estimates have become something of a ritual. Exhibit 1 Today’s projections for solar and wind power capacity in 2030 predict values much higher than those projected in 2006.

As countries aim to reach ambitious decarbonization targets, renewable energy—led by wind and solar— is poised to become the backbone of the world’s power supply. Along with capacity additions from major energy providers, new types of players are entering the market (Exhibit 2). Today’s fast followers include major oil and gas companies, which aim to shift their business models to profit from the increased demand for renewables and the electrification of vehicles, and private-equity players and institutional investors that make renewable energy a central component of their investment strategy. Leaders in the shipping industry are investing in renewables to enable the production of hydrogen and ammonia as zero-emission fuel sources; steel manufacturers are eyeing green hydrogen to decarbonize their steel production, with renewables providing the green electricity for the process. Car manufacturing companies are also striking renewable-energy deals to help power their operations and manufacturing, as well as making investments in wind and solar projects. McKinsey estimates that by 2026, global renewableelectricity capacity will rise more than 80 percent from 2020 levels (to more than 5,022 gigawatts).1 Of this growth, two-thirds will come from wind and solar, an increase of 150 percent (3,404 gigawatts). By 2035, renewables will generate 60 percent of the world’s electricity.2 But even these projections might be too low. Three years ago, we looked at advances made by renewable energy and asked, “How much faster can they grow?”3 The answer is: faster than you think they can.

Renewable-energy development in a net-zero world 3 Three core capabilities for wind and solar developers This race to build additional solar and wind capacity increases the pressure on developers to execute efficiently and heightens competition for finite resources. Still, the three winning capabilities we identified three years ago as important for building or expanding a renewables business are even more critical now. They form the bedrock required to tackle upcoming challenges: — Value-chain excellence. As competition intensifies and government support for renewables subsides, strong capabilities across the entire value chain are the required cost of admission. For instance, gaining access to scarce amounts of attractive land will require differentiation in project origination and development. As margins squeeze and operators’ exposure to risk increases, ambitious companies will want to explore new, profitable offtake markets for their electricity, such as data centers or hydrogen electrolyzers for industrial production. — Economies of scale and skill. Driven by the rapid scaling of the renewables industry, many players have built efficient operating models. However, finding employees with the necessary skills and capabilities, particularly in highdemand areas such as project development and engineering, is becoming a bottleneck for growth ambitions. — Agile operating model. Agility and speed will be key in finding innovative ways to integrate partners and in establishing robust, highperforming supply chains. They will also enable businesses to shift resources quickly to the biggest value pools and respond to changes in the landscape, such as shifting regulations or price volatility. Four challenges that will define the new era of renewable energy Leveraging these capabilities as a strong foundation, successful renewables developers must navigate an increasingly complex and competitive landscape. Specifically, they will have to focus on and address four emerging challenges: — A scarcity of top-quality land. Developers are in a constant scramble to identify new sites with increasing speed. Our analysis in Germany, a country aiming to nearly double its share of electricity coming from renewables by 2030, offers a glimpse into the constraints. Of the 51 percent of the country’s land that is potentially suitable for onshore wind farms, regulatory, environmental, and technical constraints eliminate all but 9 percent.4 Meeting capacity targets will mean adding wind turbines to 4 to 6 percent of the country, giving developers very little room for error. — A blue-collar and white-collar labor shortage. Across economies, the “Great Attrition” is making it difficult for companies to find and keep employees. Since April 2021, 20 million to 25 million US workers have quit their jobs, and 40 percent of employees globally say they are at least somewhat likely to leave their current position in the next three to six months.5 This environment presents a particularly acute challenge for industries such as renewable energy, where specific technical expertise and experience are crucial elements of success. For instance, our analysis suggests that between now and 2030, the global renewables industry will need an additional 1.1 million blue-collar workers to develop and construct wind and solar plants, and another 1.7 million to operate and maintain them.6 This includes construction laborers, electricians, truck and semitrailer drivers, and operating engineers. 4 McKinsey land use optimization model. 5 Aaron De Smet, Bonnie Dowling, Bryan Hancock, and Bill Schaninger, “The Great Attrition is making hiring harder.

The soaring cost of steel, manufacturing disruptions caused by extended lockdowns in China, and transportation backlogs at ports are already making it difficult for wind and solar developers to complete projects in their pipeline on time and on budget. Some of these pressures will abate as others move to the forefront. For instance, many of the raw materials needed to manufacture solar panels and wind turbines are projected to be in short supply. This includes nickel, copper, and rare earth metals such as neodymium and praseodymium, which are indispensable for the creation of magnets used in wind turbine generators. — Pressure on profits and volatility of returns in the short term. The increasing number of players moving into the renewable-development space, combined with reduced levels of government support and higher costs of materials, technology, and financing, is putting pressure on returns. At the same time, an all-time-high price volatility creates uncertainty and market risk. Renewables developers will need to act decisively to prepare for these upcoming challenges. In a series of future articles, we provide detailed insights on each of these pressures and share potential ways players can take action.

      "﻿October 2022 © Desmon Jiag/Getty Images Electric Power & Natural Gas Practice Renewable-energy development in a net-zero world Global decarbonization will require a massive build-out of wind and solar farms. But can developers find enough land, secure the supply chain, and recruit workers while maintaining profitability? This article is a collaborative effort by Florian Heineke, Nadine Janecke, Holger Klärner, Florian Kühn, Humayun Tai, and Raffael Winter, representing views from McKinsey’s Electric Power & Natural Gas Practice. The rapid maturation of wind and solar power has been nothing short of astonishing. Not long ago, the development of new solar and wind farms was typically driven by small regional players, and the cost was significantly higher than that of a coal plant. Today, the cost of renewables has plummeted, and many solar and wind projects are undertaken by large multinational companies, which often also announce staggering development targets. Over the past decade, the growth of renewable energy has consistently and dramatically outperformed nearly all expectations (Exhibit 1). Upward corrections of estimates have become something of a ritual. Exhibit 1 Today’s projections for solar and wind power capacity in 2030 predict values much higher than those projected in 2006.

As countries aim to reach ambitious decarbonization targets, renewable energy—led by wind and solar— is poised to become the backbone of the world’s power supply. Along with capacity additions from major energy providers, new types of players are entering the market (Exhibit 2). Today’s fast followers include major oil and gas companies, which aim to shift their business models to profit from the increased demand for renewables and the electrification of vehicles, and private-equity players and institutional investors that make renewable energy a central component of their investment strategy. Leaders in the shipping industry are investing in renewables to enable the production of hydrogen and ammonia as zero-emission fuel sources; steel manufacturers are eyeing green hydrogen to decarbonize their steel production, with renewables providing the green electricity for the process. Car manufacturing companies are also striking renewable-energy deals to help power their operations and manufacturing, as well as making investments in wind and solar projects. McKinsey estimates that by 2026, global renewableelectricity capacity will rise more than 80 percent from 2020 levels (to more than 5,022 gigawatts).1 Of this growth, two-thirds will come from wind and solar, an increase of 150 percent (3,404 gigawatts). By 2035, renewables will generate 60 percent of the world’s electricity.2 But even these projections might be too low. Three years ago, we looked at advances made by renewable energy and asked, “How much faster can they grow?”3 The answer is: faster than you think they can. Exhibit 2 Capacity additions have outperformed ambitions, with future plans scaling even higher.
